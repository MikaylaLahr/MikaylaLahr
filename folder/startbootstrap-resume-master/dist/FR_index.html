                    <h3 class="mb-0">Part 1: Open Loop Control</h3> <!----------------------------------------------->
                    <p>I initially started working on an open loop control design, before working on localization. My
                        goal for this section was to determine how far I could get in the map before the robot no longer 
                        reached the goal points. While working on this section I became even more familiar with how the 
                        robot operated. I needed to regularly change the battery as the robot behaved differently depending 
                        on how charged the battery was (moving and turning slower when the battery was not fully charged). 
                        This was important for determining how fast the robot would 
                        approach and stop before the wall and turn. In addition the right side motor of the robot has a 
                        slight delay in reaching the final set speed compared to the left side. This results in the robot 
                        initially moving straight but moving towards the left for longer distances when working with a 
                        fully charged battery. I needed to account for 
                        this factor when determining where to stop and turn the robot. This behaviour can be seen in the 
                        some of the lab report videos. The details for the planning and implementation of the open loop design is below. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Planning An Initial Design</h4> <!---------------------------------------------->
                    <img width="500" height="auto" src="Lab12/DesignMap1.png"></img>
                    <p>The above image shows the first design, marking the predicted distances that the robot needed to 
                        travel for each section of the map. While thinking through the first design I was planning on 
                        measuring the initial distance from the robot to the back wall at an angle and then recording 
                        how much the distance changed to stop the robot after around 862mm. I was also going to use the 
                        same approach for travelling from point 3 to point 4. All other distances were going to be measured 
                        from the wall. I decided to change this approach to simplify the design and minimize the room for 
                        errors. Measuring the distance to the wall at an angle could result in the robot stopping to soon 
                        or moving to far if the robot is not oriented to the correct angle when starting or turning. I 
                        decided to change the design to model the diagram below.
                    </p>
                    <img width="500" height="auto" src="Lab12/DesignMap2.png"></img>
                    <p>In this design the robot is able to get distance readings from a closer wall that the robot is 
                        directly facing. The robot also is expected to turn 90 degrees every time a rotation needs to be 
                        made, simplifying the code compared to needing to turn at around 45 degrees for two turns and then 
                        turning 90 degrees for the remaining turns. However, while physically testing the robot I did still 
                        need to adjust the angles the robot turned as not all turns worked well using 90 degrees. In the 
                        above diagram are the final used angles and distances for the robot path. The details about the 
                        design implementation are below.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Implement The Design</h4> <!---------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>When I started working on the design for the robot's path I wrote the code in sections and tested 
                        the run in parts before writing the next segment. Below is the Jupyter Notebook command and the
                        Arduino case, while loop, and functions. Each distance and angle are set separately to allow for 
                        any changes to be easily made during testing. PID control is used when the robot rotates. The 
                        FORWARD function does not use PID control for distance readings as the robot was set to move at 
                        a slower speed of 80 PWM and would not overshooot the desired stopping distance.

                    <p>As I progressed through the map it was harder to reach each point. The most common failure was 
                        missing the second to last point or overshooting the turn at point 5, resulting in the robot 
                        hitting the side of the box. 
                        <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14EqiS_azm7d-Pabpr7tT0rgovmmCRE_l?usp=sharing">This folder</a> 
                        has two videos showing errors in the initial design. One video shows the robot not reaching 
                        point 3 because the ToF sensor measured the distance to the box and not the wall. The robot stopped
                        before passing point 3. This was a frequent error and during testing I adjusted the first stopping 
                        distance and had the first angle be a rotation to -100 degrees. This allowed for more runs to be 
                        successful until the third point, as the ToF sensor did not detect the box and distance was allowed 
                        for the right side motor to slightly move the robot to the left. Unfortunately, this correction 
                        also resulted in another potential error of the robot missing point 3. When the robot had a fully 
                        charged battery, it tended to reach the first three points more frequently than if the battery was
                        not fully charged due to the right side motor reaching full speed faster when using a fully charged 
                        battery. For this reason during this lab I repeatedly recharged the batteries I was using more often 
                        than in any previous lab. In addition, the turn at point 5 was set to 80 degrees to account for the 
                        right side motor and prevent the robot from hitting the side of the box. The second video in the 
                        folder shows a failed run where the robot misses the second to last point.
                    </p>
                    <p>Below are two videos of the most successful runs. Due to using open loop control and having an error 
                        tolerance for the angle turns and variations in speed depending on the battery charge, each run was 
                        slightly different. In the first run the robot passes the third point but does not go through the 
                        center. In both runs the robot passes the last point but does not stop until after passing the point 
                        as the robot was not perfectly in line with reading the distance to stop from the smaller box. I was 
                        happy with the results as I had spent a long time working through the nuances of the robot and the
                        robot is able to make its way through the map.

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Part 2: Localization</h3> <!---------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>In addition to doing open loop control, I decided to implement localization on the robot the 
                        details about planning and implementation are found below. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Planning An Initial Design</h4> <!---------------------------------------------->
                    <p>From my observations while implementing open loop control, I decided to make some changes to the 
                        path of the robot. My plan was to perform localization starting at point 4 and continue to localize 
                        at each point (except point 6 as it occurs right next to point 5 and will be passed on the robots
                        path to point 7) until the robot completes the map. The robot will initally move using open loop 
                        control until reaching point 4. Instead of rotating clockwise and having the ToF sensor pointed 
                        towards the right side wall, I decided to rotate the robot counter clockwise and have the ToF 
                        sensor pointed towards the left side wall. The robot then moves backwards a specified distance 
                        away from the left wall. I decided to change the open loop control as in the previous section there
                        were several runs where the ToF sensor read a distance from the large square box and not the right
                        side wall. Having the ToF sensor read distances from the left wall removes the possible error that
                        the robot will sense the box and stop early. Below is a diagram of the robots path.
                    </p>
                    <img width="500" height="auto" src="Lab12/DesignMap3.png"></img>
                    <p>For localizing and moving to the next point I broke down the robots movements into five actions:
                        <li>Localization on the robot</li> 
                        <li>Compare the localization results with the desired point</li>
                        <li>Rotate the robot to face the desired point</li>
                        <li>Drive the robot for a specified distance towards the desired point</li>
                        <li>Rotate the robot back to face the right side wall for the next localization</li>
                        The Arduino open loop script and the functions I wrote to control the robot are found below:
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Open Loop Control</h3> <!------------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>Below is the Arduino case for open loop control and the code within the while loop. When run_START_CASE 
                        is set to 1 the first function entered is DISTANCE_1 and the robot starts moving forward until 
                        stopping 600mm in front of the wall. The robot turns 90 degrees counterclockwise using the 
                        ORIENTATION function and then drives backwards away from the left wall by entering the DISTANCE_2
                        function. An initial distance reading is taken from the wall and then the robot uses this distance 
                        reading to measure from and move 1500mm. The robot stops just past point 3 and turns 90 degrees 
                        and then drives forward, stopping 500mm before the bottom wall. Within the while loop and each 
                        function are if statements that determine the value of the variables count and countDis. These 
                        values change after each function is run to move onto the next step in the while loop.

                    <p>After the while loop runs, the case and function below are called to orient the robot towards the 
                        right side wall before starting localization. This allows for the robot to start localizing at
                        a yaw reading of 0 degrees.

                    <p>Below is the LOCALIZE_CASE in Arduino that calls the function LOCALIZE. The case sets the yaw 
                        reading to zero and records the previous time stamp to be used when finding the next yaw value. 
                    </p>
                    <img width="450" height="auto" src="Lab12/LocalizeCase.png"></img>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The LOCALIZE function rotates the robot 360 degrees while recording ToF sensor distance measurements. 
                        The robot had a tendency to overshoot the rotation when the goal angle was set to 20 degrees. 
                        I tested various angle changes for a 360 degree rotation and found that increments of 19 degrees
                        (+/- 1 degree) allowed for the robot to stop the rotation without overshooting. This correction 
                        worked for the first few localization attempts, but as the robot localized more the error in overshoot
                        increased. This error in rotation is also affected by angle changes to direct the robot to 
                        the desired point in the map as in the function ANGLE described in the next section.

                    <p>The below case and function rotates the robot by the calculated angle. The ANGLE function uses
                        atan2 to find the rotation angle using the inputs for the current position (curX,curY) and the
                        desired position (endX,endY). This calculated goalAngle is then compared to the current yaw 
                        reading of the robot until the error is within 1 degree of the desired angle.

                        the robot moving do not match because to record the serial monitor output I turned the robot 
                        using my hand rather than using the motors.

                    <h4 class="mb-0">Driving To The Next Point</h4> <!----------------------------------------------->
                    <p>The next section of code I wrote has the robot move from the current point (curX,curY) to the 
                        desired point (endX,endY). The case and function are below. I also subtracted 150mm from the
                        calculated value because when I was testing the robot in the map, there was consistently some 
                        overshoot when reaching the desired point due to the belief and desired points being modeled at 
                        the center of the robot and the distance readings coming from the ToF sensor at the front of 
                        the robot. An initial distance reading is taken and then the 
                        current distance reading is subtracted from the starting distance. This value is compared to 
                        the calculated disMove and the robot stops when the difference between the starting and current 
                        distance readings is greater then the value for disMove. In addition, I added a break statement 
                        that exits the while loop if the robot is within 300mm of the wall. This is to prevent the robot 
                        crashing or getting stuck in a corner.

                    <h4 class="mb-0">Rotating The Robot For The Next Localization</h3> <!---------------------------->
                    <p>The last step before the next localization attempt is to rotate the robot again towards the right
                        side wall. During this step the function NEW_ANGLE is called, using the negative of the same 
                        angle calculated during the "Changing the Angle" step. The function NEW_ANGLE was described 
                        previously in the lab.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Writing A Python Script</h3> <!------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>Below is the python script used during the open loop control and localization of the robot.</p>
                    <p>Step 1: START_CASE is called with inputs for run_START_CASE, setAngle, dis1, dis2, dis3, Kp, Ki, 
                        and Kd. The robot navigates to point 4 before stopping. NEW_ANGLE_CASE is called with inputs for 
                        run_NEW_ANGLE_CASE and setAngle. The robot rotates to face the right side wall. 
                    </p>
                    <img width="600" height="auto" src="Lab12/Python4.png"></img>
                    <p>Below is the function perform_observation_loop in Jupyter Notebook that calls the LOCALIZATION_CASE
                        to rotate the robot and collect ToF data to use in the Bayes Filter.
                    </p>
                    <img width="600" height="auto" src="Lab12/Python5.png"></img>
                    <p>Step 2: During this step the plotter is reset and then points 1, 2, and 3 are plotted on the graph 
                        assuming that the robot has passed all of those points using open loop control. The while loop is 
                        entered and the robot starts localizing. After localizing, LOCALIZE_CASE is turned off and the belief 
                        of where the robot is on the map is compared to the desired point. 
                    </p>
                    <img width="600" height="auto" src="Lab12/Python1.png"></img>
                    <p>Step 3 (Inside While Loop): An if statement is made to check to see if the belief is within 1 foot 
                        of the desired point. 
                        If the belief is within 1 foot, the ground truth value for the desired point is plotted and the 
                        values for the index i and the success are increased. The x and y coordinates for the current 
                        belief and desired point are assigned to variables (curX,curY) and (endX,endY). A string using 
                        the found point values is created and ANGLE_CASE is called to rotate the robot to face the next 
                        desired point. After the robot rotates the case is turned off. Then the DISTANCE_CASE is called 
                        using the same inputs and the robot travels to the next point. After moving the desired distance, 
                        the case is turned off. Finally, the robot uses the negative of the angle found during the "Rotate 
                        to new angle" step as an input to the NEW_ANGLE_CASE to rotate towards the right side wall and then 
                        the case is turned off when the robot stops. 
                    </p>
                    <img width="600" height="auto" src="Lab12/Python2.png"></img>
                    <p>Step 4 (Inside While Loop): The else statement runs if the belief is not within 1 foot of the 
                        desired point. All of
                        the previously run cases are used in the same manner, except the index and success variables are
                        not increased. The robot is still trying to reach the desired waypoint.

                    <p>Localization Starting At Point 4:</p>
                    <p>The best localization attempt occurred during testing 
                        when I started the robot at point 4. In the video the robot is able to localize around points 4, 5, 
                        and 7, (passing point 6 on its way to point 7). The robot also eventually passes points 8 and 9 but 
                        is not able to achieve good localization results at those locations. In the video it can be seen that
                        the more localization attempts are run the more error accumulates in the direction the robot faces 
                        before starting the next localization attempt. When the robot reached points 8 and 9 the ToF sensor 
                        was no longer pointed directly towards the right side wall resulting in poor distance data when 
                        running the Bayes Filter.

                    <p>The below video shows another attempt at running the full course as it can be seen the robot 
                        passes the first three points before being rotated and starting localization. The robot got stuck 
                        in the right bottom corner during this attempt. I ran the robot several times using localization and 
                        the most common reason for an unsuccessful run was due to the robot not localizing around point 5.

                    </p>
                    <p>Overall, I am happy with the results I was able to achieve. The robot was able to localize well within 
                        the general area that it was located. The only exception was for the second to last point in the first 
                        video where localization believed the robot was located near the bottom wall of the map. 
                        There was a lot of planning and testing 
                        during the lab and a lot of code was written for the robot to move as expected. It was very exciting 
                        to see the robot navigate through the map and I enjoyed working on this task for the final lab report. 
                        Thank you!

                    <p>The first lab task was to run the provided Bayes Filter simulation. The lab11_sim.ipynb file was 
                        downloaded and a screenshot of the final result is below as well as a 
                        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/120ek_jK8Y9CPmBWIn1pVJgnnejH-On_O0puMCUnvyTg/edit">link to the data</a>
                        from the simulation. 
                        The red line is odometry, the green line is the ground truth, and the blue line is the 
                        belief. The map is a three dimensional grid (x, y, theta). The dimension of x is 12, the dimension 
                        of y is 9, and the dimension of theta is 18.

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Arduino IDE Code</h3> <!-------------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>To perform localization on the robot the Arduino IDE code from Lab 9: Mapping was used to rotate 
                        the robot 360 degrees. The setAngle was changed from 10 degrees, used in Lab 9, to 20 degrees 
                        for Lab 11. I removed some of the append statements in case SEND_ORIENTATION_DATA to only send 
                        time, angle in 20 degree increments, and the distance readings at each angle increment. In the 
                        main while loop I changed how I stored the distance data and yaw readings. I initially stored 
                        the readings as variables before assigning them to an array at each 20 degree increment. The 
                        code is below.

                    <p>The code lab11_real.ipynb was downloaded and opened in Jupyter Notebook. 
                        The function perform_observation_loop was 
                        written to sort through the collected data from one rotation. First arrays are established and
                        then the command to send orientation data is run. The asynicio function was used to run the 
                        while loop until 18 data readings are sent over Bluetooth. The for loop assigns the angle readings 
                        to the sensor_bearings array and the distance readings, converted from millimeters to meters, to
                        the sensor_ranges array. Initially, I put the command to run the ORIENTATION_CASE inside 
                        of the perform_observation_loop function, but I decided to run the rotation first before calling 
                        the function. Removing the command to run ORIENTATION_CASE from inside of the function allowed 
                        me to more easily turn on/off the rotation.  
                    </p>
                    <p>The function perform_observation_loop is below:</p>

                    <p>The results of rotating the robot at the four marked positions are below. The four marked positions 
                        include: (-3ft, -2ft, 0deg), (0ft, 3ft, 0deg), (5ft, -3ft, 0deg), and (5ft, 3ft, 0deg). The robot 
                        was run around 4-5 times at each point. Two runs for each point are shown below. The ground truth 
                        is plotted as the green dot and is the location where the robot rotated. The belief of the robots 
                        position is plotted as the blue dot. The ToF sensor used to collect distance readings was located 
                        on the front of the robot, between the left and right sides of the robot. When the robot was at 
                        zero degrees the ToF sensor was pointed towards the rightside wall. The robot turned counterclockwise
                        in the same manner as in Lab 9. The Jupyter Notebook code to plot each Ground Truth value is below:

                            As can be seen in the below polar plot, the robot sensed the surrounding walls very well. 
                            I reran the rotation several (5) times and this point had the most rotations result in the
                            Belief being the same as the Ground Truth. This is a result of the several walls surrounding 
                            the robot when rotating. The next run shows one of the runs where the Belief was different 
                            then the Ground Truth.

                            I was surprised to achieve this result as there are not a lot of nearby walls to use for 
                            localization and I suspected that this would be the hardest point to localize. As can be 
                            seen in the below polar plot, the robot was able to sense the surrounding walls and obstacles.

                        <p>Some runs of the robot for the bottom right point resulted in a Belief that was plotted around 
                            (-0.8m, 0.2m) as the corner outside of the map resembled the lower right corner inside of the 
                            map. I found it surprising that the Belief would be plotted outside of the map and discussed 
                            the results with a TA. To address this issue the probability that the robot is located outside
                            of the map can be set to zero in the Bayes Filter.

                        <p>For run 2 of the top right point, the Belief was located 0.3044 meters below the Ground Truth. 
                            As can be seen in the below polar plot the robot again had difficulty achieving the correct 
                            distance measurements for the right side wall, which may have impacted the localization Belief.

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Comparison of Localization Results</h3> <!-------------------------------------->
                    <p>Overall, the localization implemented on the robot was able to achieve Belief results that 
                        aligned with the Ground Truth values for 3 out of the 4 tested points (bottom left, top middle, 
                        bottom right). I also included non-ideal runs in the lab report to show that even for non-ideal 
                        rotations the robot would still localize fairly well. The bottom left point had the most number 
                        of rotations (4/5) that resulted in the Belief being in the same location as the Ground Truth. 
                        This is compared to the Top Middle having 1/4, Top Right having 0/4, and the Bottom Right 
                        having 2/4. I suspect that the Top Right did not achieve any Belief values that were the same 
                        as the Ground Truth values because the rotations at that point did not adequately pick up on the 
                        straight edges of the wall.

<!-- Lab 10 Prelab --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab</h2>
                    <p>Before starting the lab, I familiarized myself with how the Bayes Filter worked and how to 
                        implement the Bayes filter for the robot in simulation. Localization and of the robot determines 
                        where the robot is in the enviroment. There is a predition and update step 
                        of the Bayes filter. The prediction step uses the control input and accounts for the noise 
                        from the actuator to predict the new location of the robot. After the prediction step, the 
                        robot rotates 360 degrees gathering distance measurement data. The update step uses the gathered 
                        distance measurements to determine the real location of the robot. The Bayes Filter from Lecture 16 
                        is below:

                        and 20 degrees. The grid is (12,9,18) in three dimensions, totalling 1944 cells. The discritized 
                        grid map is:

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Implementation</h3> <!---------------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>Five functions were written to run the Bayes Filter as outlined below.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Compute Control</h4> <!--------------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>The control information from the robot is used to find the first rotation, translation, and 
                        second rotation. The inputs include the current position (cur_pose) and the previous position 
                        (prev_pose). The return values include the first rotation (delta_rot_1), the translation 
                        (delta_trans), and the second rotation (delta_rot_2). The Lecture 17 slide with the equations
                        to find the odometry model parameters is below: 
                    </p>
                    <img width="450" height="auto" src="Lab10/ComputeControlEq.png"></img>
                    <p>The above equations were modeled in Jupyter Notebook. The code is found below. First the 
                        differences in the y and x positions are found (y_comp and x_comp). Then the normalized rotations 
                        are calculated as well as the translation. 
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="mb-0">Odometry Motion Model</h4> <!--------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>The odometry motion model finds the probability that the robot performed the motion that was 
                        calculated in the previous step. The inputs include the current position (cur_pose), previous
                        position (prev_pose), and odometry control values (u) for rotation 1, translation, and rotation 
                        2. The return value is the probablility ( p(x'|x,u) ) that the robot achieved the current 
                        position (x'), knowing the previous position (x) and odometry control values (u). A Gaussian 
                        distribution is used. Each motion is assumed to be an independent event. The probability of
                        each event is then multiplied together to find the probability of the entire motion. The Jupyter 
                        Notebook code is found below.
                    </p>
                    <img width="700" height="auto" src="Lab10/odom_motion_model.png"></img>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Prediction Step</h4> <!--------------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>The prediction step of the Bayes Filter as implemented in Jupyter Notebook uses six for loops 
                        to calculate the probability that the robot moved to the next grid cell. The inputs include the
                        current odometry position (cur_odom) and the previous odometry position (prev_odom).
                        The if statement in the pediction step code is 
                        used to speed up the filter. If the belief is less than 0.0001 than the three remaining 
                        for loops will not be entered as the robot is unlikely to be in the remaining grid cells. If 
                        the belief is greater than or equal to 0.0001 the probability will be calculated. The code for 
                        calculating the probability is below.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="mb-0">Sensor Model</h4> <!------------------------------------------------------------>
                    <p>The sensor model function finds the probability of the sensor measurements, modelled as a 
                        Gaussian distribution. The length of the array is 18 as the robot measures 18 different distance 
                        reading values. The input includes the 1D observation array (obs) for the robot position. The
                        function returns a 1D array of the same length including the likelihood of each event (prob_array).
                        The Jupyter Notebook code is below.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="mb-0">Update Step</h4> <!------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>The update step calculates the belief of the robot for each grid cell. The probability ( p(z|x) )
                        is multiplied by the predicted belief (loc.bel_bar) to find the belief (loc.bel). The belief is 
                        then normalized. The code can be found below.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Simulation Results</h3> <!------------------------------------------------------>
                    <p>Two runs of the Bayes Filter simulation are found below. The green line is the ground truth, 
                        the blue line is the belief, and the red line is the odometry measurements. The lighter grid 
                        cells represent a higher belief. For both runs the ground truth and the belief are close 
                        together. Both runs were 15 iterations.

                        <p>Option 2: Orientation Control was chosen as the PID controller for the lab. The PID controller 
                            results in the robot performing on-axis turns in 10 degree increments. The ToF sensor used
                            to collect distance readings is located on the front of the robot between the left and right 
                            motor sides. 
                        </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Code For Orientation Control</h4> <!------------------------------------------->
                        <p>The Arduino code for the created ORIENTATION_CASE in the while loop is found below. </p>
                        <img width="600" height="auto" src="Lab9/Case1.png"></img>
                        <img width="600" height="auto" src="Lab9/Case2.png"></img>
                        <p>First 
                            the distance is found using the readings from the ToF sensors, then the yaw angle is found 
                            using the IMU sensor. The PID controller value is used in the RIGHT_MOTOR and LEFT_MOTOR 
                            functions to determine the motor input value. If the error between the current yaw angle 
                            and the setAngle (10 degrees) is less than -0.5 degrees or greater than 0.5 degrees then 
                            the RIGHT_MOTOR and LEFT_MOTOR functions will run. The "stop" variable is set to be 360 
                            divided by the "setAngle" variable, which is equal to 10. The results in stop = 36 
                            increments. If variable "end" is less than "stop" the robot will stop for one second. 
                            I stopped the robot for one second to ensure that the ToF sensor is pointed towards a 
                            fixed point in space. 
                            The total yaw angle is recorded by adding the current total to the current yaw value (yaw_arr). 
                            The yaw value is then set to zero for the next iteration of the while loop. Resetting the 
                            yaw value for the IMU sensor reduces gyroscope drift.
                            If the "end" 
                            value is greater than or equal to the "stop" value the robot will stop and no new data will 
                            be recorded into the yaw_arr array. 
                        </p>

                            worked to move the robot in 10 degree increments. Each time the PID orientation controller
                            starts, yaw[0], yaw_arr[0], and the total are set to zero. In addition the stop variable 
                            is found. Graphs showing the changing yaw angles to confirm the PID controller works are 
                            found in the next section.

                            angle. The robot stays inside of one floor tile for the duration of the turn.

                        <p>I plotted the values of yaw for each 10 degree increment. As can be seen in the below graph
                            the PID controller works as expected. After yaw increases to 10 degrees, the value of yaw 
                            is reset to zero and then again increases to 10 degrees for the next increment. The slight 
                            variation in the final yaw value is due to the -0.5 to 0.5 degree tolerance.

                        <p>The total angle values were found by adding each final yaw value (between 9.5 and 10.5 
                            degrees) to a summation of all previous yaw values. The values and graph for an example 
                            turn are found below.

                        <p>In the above graph as the turn progresses the angles remain accurate as the summation 
                            calculation is correct to the yaw reading of the robot, but the angles slightly vary from 
                            the ideal 360 degree turn values. To address this I also performed half turns from 0 to 180
                            degrees, and 180 to 360 degrees. The angle values and corresponding graphs can be found 
                            below:

                        <p>The half turns in the above graphs are more in line with the ideal angles. When testing the 
                            robot in the lab, I collected angle data for full turns and half turns.

                    <h4 class="mb-0">Average And Maximum Error</h4> <!---------------------------------------------->
                        <p>There is no significant gyroscope drift in the IMU sensor because the robot resets the yaw 
                            value to zero after every 10 degree rotation. For a 360 degree rotation, the maximum error
                            in the final angle value is -18 or +18 degrees (342 degrees or 378 degrees) if the yaw angle 
                            for every rotation is 9.5 degrees or 10.5 degrees respectively. For a 360 degree rotation,
                            the average error in the final angle value is -9 or +9 degrees (351 degrees or 369 degrees)
                            if the yaw angle for every rotation is 9.75 degrees or 10.25 degrees respectively. As noted 
                            previously, the final angle value for an example 360 degree turn is 353.859 degrees. A 
                            difference of (360 - 353.859) degrees = 6.141 degrees. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The robot turns roughly on axis, but the potential difference in the starting position and
                            ending position may result in error for the distance measurements. Based on observing the 
                            motion of the robot the average error between the starting position and the ending position 
                            is 12mm, and the maximum acceptable error is 25mm. Due to friction, the robot might move 
                            off axis more for one rotation, while staying on axis for the next rotation. Assuming the 
                            robot moves off axis the same amount for each rotation, the average error in position for 
                            each rotation is 12mm/36 = 0.3333mm. The maximum error in position for each rotation is 
                            25mm/36 = 0.6944mm.

                    <h4 class="mb-0">Execute Turn At Each Marked Position</h4> <!----------------------------------->
                        <p>The robot was placed at each of the following points: (-3,-2), (0,0), (0,3), (5,3), and (5,-3).
                            The image below shows each of the points in the lab. 
                        </p>
                        <img width="500" height="auto" src="Lab9/LabPoints.png"></img>
                        <p>The distance was measured using the front ToF sensor between the left and right motor sides. 
                            The data collected was sent over Bluetooth to Jupyter Notebook to be plotted. The robot 
                            was started in the same orietation, facing the right side wall of the lab, for each full 
                            turn and each half turn starting at zero degrees. For half turns starting at 180 degrees, 
                            the robot started facing the left side wall. The range of potential angle values for each 
                            ideal 10 degree rotation is 9.5 degrees to 10.5 degrees. There is a -/+ 0.5 degree range 
                            for the robot to stop and collect a distance measurement. Due to the range of degree values,
                            it can not be assumed that the robot will stop at exactly 10 degrees every time it rotates.
                            This behaviour was desribed in the "Code for Orientation Control" section at the beginning 
                            of the lab report. The distance measurements can not be assumed to be spaced equally in 
                            angular space. To address this issue, I did not assume that the robot stopped at exactly 
                            10 degrees for every rotation and instead recorded a "total" variable value that added the 
                            angle that the robot stopped at to the previously recorded stopping angle. This allowed me 
                            to plot the distance measurements with the correct recorded angles.

                        <p>This section details the first attempt at collecting data at each point. The data collected 
                            for each point in the lab is plotted in the below graphs. For each point I plotted a polar 
                            graph and a global frame graph. The first two graphs show all of the data I 
                            collected for each point. The next two graphs show the data that I choose to keep when 
                            combining all of the global plots. In this section I noticed that the ToF sensor was pointed 
                            too downwards, resulting in a lot of noise in the middle of the plots. The noise resulted in
                            the boundaries of the walls being hard to determine. After plotting this section I readjusted 
                            the ToF sensor to be pointed more upwards to avoid hitting the floor of the map.

                    <p>I plotted the distances in the global frame using the below transformation matrix. The 
                        transformation matrix converts the frame of the robot used to collect the sensor measurements 
                        into the global frame. The example below is for the point (-3,-2). The variable "theta" is the 
                        angle measurement in radians relative to the origin of the global frame and "dis" is the 
                        distance measurement. One ToF sensor between the left and right sides of the robot was used to 
                        collect distance data.

                    <p>The objective of the lab is to implement a stunt on the robot using the knowledge gained from 
                        previous labs. Labs 5-8 detail PID, 
                        sensor fusion, and stunts. This lab is focused on using the ToF sensor and IMU sensor to drive 
                        the robot forward and then turn 180 degrees when the robot is within 3ft (914mm) of the wall. 
                        Task B: Orientation Control will be implemented on the robot.

                <h2 class="mb-2.5">Lab Task B: Orientation Control</h2>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Initial Approach Before Changing Designs</h3> <!------------------------------->
                        <p>My inital approach to the orientation control stunt was to break down the stunt into three 
                            separate parts: driving towards the wall, turning, driving away from the wall. When driving 
                            straight towards the wall the robot uses PID control on the speed before slowing down and 
                            turning. The speed PID control function can be found below:
                        </p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/MikaylaLahr/cd02de330d6d252c54f4ca65fb994a79.js"></script>
                        <p>After the robot is within 3ft of the wall, PID control on orientation is used to turn the robot 
                            180 degrees. The PID control value is determined by the yaw angle reading from the IMU sensor. 
                            If the PID control value is positive the wheels on the right side of the robot will move forwards
                            and the wheels on the left side of the robot will move backwards.
                            If the PID control value is negative the wheels on the right side of the robot will move backwards
                            and the wheels on the left side of the robot will move forwards.
                            The orientation PID control function can be found below:
                        </p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/MikaylaLahr/3a82ec2548d2294b90f259d1163cae18.js"></script>
                        <p>The above two functions were called inside of the while loop. If the distance error is greater
                            than zero, the speed PID control function is called. If the distance error is less than zero 
                            the orientation PID control function is called to turn the robot. The while loop can be found 
                            below:
                        </p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/MikaylaLahr/a5f60f368a530ce0ff772b9adc939ccd.js"></script>
                        <p>Before implementing the final part of the task (driving away from the wall), I ran the above 
                            Arduino script. The inputs included a start/stop integer (1/0); a setDistance for the robot 
                            to start turning; and the Kp, Ki, and Kd PID values. While running the Arduino IDE code 
                            multiple times with different setDistance values (914mm-1300mm) and PID values, the robot 
                            did not perform in the expected manner. The robot would often either hit the wall or turn too 
                            late even when inputting larger setDistance values. In addition, the robot turned too slow 
                            whe inputting smaller Kp values (such as 0.5), or would spin multiple times when inputting 
                            larger Kp values (such as 2).
                            Videos showing the behaviour of the robot are below:
                        </p>
                        <p>The robot hits the wall before turning (setDistance = 915mm, Kp = 0.5):</p>
                        <iframe width="550" height="400" src="https://youtube.com/embed/9L0uD5fG9t8"></iframe>
                        <p>The robot stops before hitting the wall, but turns too slowly during orientation control 
                            (setDistance = 1100mm, Kp = 0.5):
                        </p>
                        <iframe width="550" height="400" src="https://youtube.com/embed/ROrj824-twE"></iframe>
                        <p>When a high value of 2 was used for Kp, the robot would spin too fast and not correct itself:</p>
                        <iframe width="550" height="400" src="https://youtube.com/embed/_CRFOAtSy6s"></iframe>
                        <p>In addition, there were some bad runs that resulted in the robot turning towards the right 
                            immediately after starting the stunt due to the input PWM values: 
                        </p>
                        <iframe width="550" height="400" src="https://youtube.com/embed/Hwz2Dv5nzv8"></iframe>
                        <p>After continuously testing the robot, I decided to write a new Arduino IDE script that only 
                            used orientation control. The robot runs towards the wall at a constant speed, and within 
                            the desired setDistance turns 180 degrees and moves away from the wall.  
                        </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Second Approach</h3> <!--------------------------------------------------------->
                         <h4 class="mb-0">Driving Straight</h4> <!--------------------------------------------------->
                        <p>I first started 
                            working on implementing orientation control while the robot is driving forwards. Orientation 
                            control when the robot is driving forwards keeps the robot moving in a straight line. The robot 
                            is set to run at a base speed and PID control using the readings from the IMU correct the 
                            orientation of the robot to keep the robot at the starting yaw angle. Yaw was initially set 
                            to zero each time the case ran. Below are some videos of the robot being tested using orientation 
                            control at low speeds. Initially I tested the robot using the calibration factor of 1.1667 
                            found in Lab 4, setting a base speed of 80 for pin 12 and 93 for pin 9. I found that setting 
                            each side of the robot to different speeds resulted in the robot moving towards the right 
                            or left as can be seen below:
                        </p>
                        <iframe width="550" height="400" src="https://youtube.com/embed/v8gcEDruMEE"></iframe>
                        <p>I decided to set both pins to the same PWM value of 80 that resulted in the robot moving 
                            straight, as can be seen below:
                        </p>
                        <iframe width="550" height="400" src="https://youtube.com/embed/c0YJfiJh3F8"></iframe>
                        <h3 class="mb-0">Code and Turning</h3> <!--------------------------------------------------->
                        <p>I added to the code for orientation control to make the robot turn 180 degress, rather than 
                            stopping as in the previous step. Initially yaw is set to zero and a base speed of 150 PWM
                            was used for the motors on both sides of the robot. I tested various values for the 
                            setDistance and found that 1300mm allows the robot to recognize the wall with enough time 
                            to turn 180 degrees within 3ft and drive away from the wall. The Arduino code that runs 
                            inside the while loop is below. First the distance reading from the ToF sensor is found and
                            used to calculate the error between the ToF sensor measurement and the setDistance. Then 
                            the yaw angle is found using the IMU and the error between the yaw reading and the desired 
                            setAngle is calculated. The yaw angle is used to find the orientation PID control value. 
                            If the distance error is less than zero (robot is past 1300mm) and the setAngle equals 0, 
                            the setAngle will be changed to 180. If the orietation error is greater than or equal to -3, 
                            or less than or equal to 3, the left and right side motors will be set to the base speed.
                            If the previous condition is not met, the left side motor will be set to the base speed
                            minus the PID control value and the right side motor will be set to the base speed added 
                            to the PID control value. The code inside the while loop is found below:
                        </p>

                        <p>The Arduino cases and Jupyter Notebook commands for STUNT_CASE and SEND_STUNT_DATA are below.
                            The ToF distance sensor starts ranging, yaw is set to zero, endTime is found, and 
                            previousTime_0 is found when the run_STUNT_CASE is set to 1.

                            <li>e: distance error in millimeters</li>
                            <li>a: setAngle in degrees (this is the desired angle used to find the error in orientation)</li>
                            <li>eo: yaw angle error</li>
                            <li>PID_O: orientation PID control value</li>
                            When the setAngle changes the PID control value changes, which changes the speed of the motors.

                        <p>I implemented the Kalman Filter on the robot for extra credit. To complete this task I needed 
                            to install the Basic Linear Algebra Library on Arduino IDE.
                            To implement the Kalman 
                            Filter I first created two new cases in Arduino IDE: KF_DATA and SEND_KF_DATA. These cases 
                            are similar to the cases used to start/stop the PID controller and send PID controller data,
                            but I added array's for Kalman Filter time (KF_Time) and the Kalman filter distance 
                            (mu_Store). I added a delay in KF_CASE before running the while loop. When I was testing the
                            filter I was repeatedly starting with distances of 0mm. The delay after the ToF distance 
                            sensor starts ranging reduces the amount of 0mm distance readings when starting the filter. 
                            The Arduino cases and Jupyter Notebook commands can be found below:

                        <p>After creating the cases for the Kalman Filter, I then started working on writing a Kalman 
                            Filter function in Arduino IDE. The final initialization of the matrices is below:

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Step 1: Kalman Filter Function</h3> <!------------------------------------------>
                        <p>The first function that I wrote for the lab was the function Kalman_Filter() that is called 
                            from inside the larger while loop. To perform this task, I referenced the Jupyter Notebook 
                            code I wrote for Lab 7 and modified the code for the Arduino IDE syntax. The function can 
                            be seen below:
                        </p>
                        <img width="500" height="auto" src="Lab8EC/KF_Function.png"></img>
                        <p>The Ad (discritized A) and Bd (discritized B) matrices are updated each time the Kalman Filter
                            is called to use the most recent dt value. I printed the dt (time difference) values to the 
                            Serial Monitor and observed that the dt values slightly varied each time the while loop ran. 
                            The variable dt is how fast the while loop runs and ranged from around 10ms to 25ms. After
                            finding Ad and Bd, mu_p and sigma_p are calculated. The if statement of the filter is the 
                            update step and runs when there is a new TOF sensor reading (newTOF == 1). The else statement
                            is the prediction step and assigns the mu_p value to mu and the sigma_p value to sigma. 
                            During both steps the first value for mu is stored in the array mu_Store.

                    <h4 class="mb-0">Using ToF Readings For PID Loop</h4> <!---------------------------------------->
                        <p>I started working on the calling the Kalman Filter from inside the while loop by modifying 
                            the script for my PID controller. After finding the ToF sensor readings and running the PID 
                            controller within the larger while loop, I added an if statement inside the loop to call the
                            Kalman Filter to find the update values. The if statement runs if dStart == 1 and 
                            if the currect distance value is not equal to the previous distance value. The variable dStart
                            is set to 1 if the new ToF sensor distance is not the same value as the previous sensor distance.
                            If the current distance reading is the same as the previous distance reading dStart is set to 0. 
                            The if statement to call the update of the Kalman Filter is below:
                        </p>

                        <p>The PID controller was run using values of Kp = 0.05, Ki = 0.0000008, and Kd = 0.5. A test run 
                            showing the plotted ToF data and the Kalman Filter updates is shown below. It can be seen that
                            the Kalman Filter updates align with each new reading of the ToF sensor. 
                        </p>

                        <p>After successfully implemeting the update step of the Kalman Filter, I started working on 
                            the prediction step.

                    <h4 class="mb-0">Using ToF Readings and Predicted Distances For PID Loop</h4> <!---------------->
                        <p>I started the next step by removing the PID control from the larger while loop and creating 
                            a separate function called PID_Function(). A separate function for PID control allowed for 
                            me to more easily switch the order to performing the Kalman Filter before the PID controller.
                            Previously the PID controller used the ToF sensor measurements every time the loop ran. In 
                            the new iteration of the code, if the update step of the filter runs, the distance measurement 
                            used will be the ToF sensor reading. If the prediction step runs the most current value of mu
                            will be used in the PID controller. The if and else statements for the update and prediction steps
                            are shown below. The variable dis is the 
                            distance measurement used in the PID controller. The u value for the Kalman Filter was calculated 
                            the same as in Jupyter Notebook using the PID control values. 
                        </p>

                        <img width="500" height="auto" src="Lab8EC/PID_Function.png"></img>
                        <p>The PID controller was run using the same Kp, Ki, and Kd values as the previous section. An initial test run 
                            showing the plotted ToF data and the Kalman Filter updates is shown below. The graphs show that the filter is
                            predicting distances between ToF readings, but the predicted values do not follow the trend of the data 
                            towards the next update value.

                        <p>To address the above issue, I multiplied the B matrix by 3 and again tested the robot. The graphs below show 
                            that multiplying matrix B by 3 did not significantly change the predicted values.

                        <p>I then multiplied the B matrix by 6 and achieved the below results. The predicted values trend downwards, but 
                            still do not reach the update values.
                        </p>

                    <p>Throughout more testing, I determined that a good value to multuiply the B matrix with is 8. The Kalman Filter 
                        updates align with each new reading of the ToF sensor and the prediction values follow the trend of the data. 
                        Below are two sets of graphs showing data that was recorded after the B matrix was multiplied by 8. Needing to 
                        multiply the B matrix by 8 indicates that the value found for m during the Jupyter Lab simulation does not work 
                        as well when implementing the Kalman Filter on the robot.

                    <p>In addition during testing, I accidentally set the robot to a higher speed than necessary and the robot 
                        ran into multiple walls and did not always travel in a straight line for the below run. I decided to run the collected data
                        through the Kalman Filter to see the outcome. The graphs below show that the update values and some of 
                        the predicted values align with the recorded ToF data. The Kalman Filter is able to update to the correct
                        ToF value, even during somewhat random running conditions.

                     <h4 class="mb-0">Issues and Mistakes During Implementation</h4> <!----------------------------->
                        <p>While I was implementing the Kalman Filter onto the robot I was able to work through most
                            of the debugging in an efficient manner. One mistake that I made early during implementation 
                            was not converting dt to seconds which caused my predicted values to drastically increase or 
                            decrease. Initially I thought that there was a problem with my sigma values and spent time 
                            changing the sigma values to see if there was any change. This did not work and I discovered 
                            the issue with dt during office hours.

                    <p>The objective of the lab is to gain experience implementing Kalman Filters. Labs 5-8 detail PID, 
                        sensor fusion, and stunts. This lab is focused on using a Kalman Filter to predict ToF sensor 
                        distance readings of the robot. The code from Lab 5: Linear PID Control will be used to gather
                        data, having the robot speed towards a wall and stop 1ft in front of the wall. A Kalman Filter
                        will be implemented in Jupyter Notebook using the collected data.

                    <p>A Kalman Filter uses a state space model to predict the location (distance from the wall) of 
                        the robot. The location of the robot is predicted and then updated using the ToF sensor reading.
                        The prediction and update steps from Lecture 13 are below:
                    </p>
                        <img width="350" height="auto" src="Lab7/PredictAndUpdate.png"></img>
                    <p>The state space model is used to find the A, B, and C matrices. The state space model for the 
                        robot from Lecture 13 is below. The model uses drag (d) and momentum (m) to form the A and B 
                        matrices. The two states are the location of the robot and the robots velocity.
                    </p>
                        <img width="200" height="auto" src="Lab7/StateSpace.png"></img>
                    <p>The first part of the lab is estimating the drag and momentum of the robot using steady state
                        velocity. One difference from the lecture slides is that for this lab the C matrix will be 
                        C = [1 0]
                    </p>

                <h2 class="mb-2.5">Lab Tasks</h2>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Estimate Drag and Momentum</h3> <!--------------------------------------------->
                    <p>The drag and momentum for the A and B matrices are estimated using a step response. The robot 
                        drives towards a wall at a constant input motor speed. The ToF sensor distance measurements 
                        and motor input values are recorded. Velocity is calculated and plotted along with the 90% rise
                        time. The data is used to determine the drag and momentum and build the state space model of the
                        system.
                    </p>
                    <p>The equations for drag and momentum are below:</p>
                         <img width="300" height="auto" src="Lab7/d_m_Matrices.png"></img>
                    <p>The step response u(t) was chosen to be a PWM value of 165. The step response is 64.71% of the 
                        maximum u PWM value of 255. I choose a PWM value of 165 as it was the fastest the robot could
                        move while still moving straight for a distance of around 6.5ft. I collected time, ToF distance 
                        readings, and used these readings to calculated the velocity.
                        To ensure that the step time 
                        was long enough for the robot to reach steady state, I ran the test multiple times. The results 
                        from the first test are below: 
                    </p>
                        <img width="500" height="auto" src="Lab7/Dm_Trial1.png"></img>
                    <p>Looking at the results from the first test it can be seen that the maximum velocity reached is 
                        just over -2000mm/s. This velocity was only reached once. To confirm the steady state speed, 
                        the test was run again and the following results were plotted:
                    </p>
                        <img width="500" height="auto" src="Lab7/DM_Trial2.png"></img>
                    <p>From the above graph it can be seen that the steady state velocity is just over -2000mm/s, or 
                        more specifically -2031.91mm/s. Using a 90% rise time a line on the above graph was plotted 
                        showing 90% of the settling value. This value is (-2031.91mm/s * 0.9) = -1828.72mm/s. 
                        The 90% rise time can be determined from the graph as 1.32s. The steady state velocity is 
                        used to find the drag. The drag and rise time are used to find the momentum. The calculations 
                        to find drag (d) and momentum (m) are found below:
                    </p>
                         <img width="350" height="auto" src="Lab7/d_m_Calc.png"></img>
                    <p>Calculated: d = 0.0004921 and m = 0.0002821</p>
                    <p>Drag is inversly proportional to the speed of the robot and affects how much the system reacts to 
                        changes in u. Momentum relates to how much effort is needed to change the velocity. Higher 
                        momentum signifies that more effort needs to be exerted to change the velocity, whereas lower
                        momentum signifies that less effort needs to be exerted to change the velocity.
                    </p>
                    <p>The collected data array's from all trials were stored in Jupyter Notebook in case the data 
                        needed to be used in the future. The code to find the steady state velocity can be found here:

                    <p>The A and B matrices were computed using the calculated values for d and m. From the state space 
                        equation the A and B matrices are:

                    <p>The A and B matrices were calculated as seen below:</p>
                        <img width="300" height="auto" src="Lab7/ABCalculation.png"></img>
                    <p>The discritized A and B matrices are calculated using the following method from Lecture 13:</p>
                        <img width="300" height="auto" src="Lab7/LectureAdBd.png"></img>
                    <p>Initially, the sampling time for the discritized Ad and Bd matrices was calculated by subtracting the first 
                        time stamp from the second time stamp. After looking closely at the data, the sampling time 
                        between each time step was slightly different. I changed the calculation for Delta_T to be an average
                        of all of the sampling time differences. The Delta_T was recalculated for each new dataset that I graphed.
                        Below is an example calculation of the discritized Ad and Bd matrices, using the found sampling time of 0.008s
                        for the PID loop in Lab 5. This dt is how fast the PID control loop is running. 
                    </p>
                        <img width="400" height="auto" src="Lab7/newAdBdCalculation.png"></img>
                    <p>The provided code in the lab report as well as my method of finding Delta_T was used to implement the 
                        calculation in Python as seen below:
                    </p>
                        <img width="400" height="auto" src="Lab7/AB_dt_AdBd_Calc.png"></img>
                    <p>There are two different time array's. One method of finding Delta_T uses the time array of the PID 
                        controller (array: time). This method was for the 5000 level task, resulting in a faster frequecy than 
                        the frequency found for the ToF readings (array: timeF). In between ToF readings the prediction step 
                        of the Kalman Filter estimates the state of the robot.
                    </p>

                    <p>The C matrix for the state space is C = [1 0]. C is an m x n matrix where m is the number of 
                        states measured (1, ToF sensor distance) and n is the dimensions of the state space (2, ToF 
                        distance and velocity). The initial state is the first distance measurement and a velocity of 0
                        as the robot is not yet moving. The positive distance from the wall was measured.
                    </p>
                    <p>Below is the Python code to establish the C matrix and initialize the state vector for the ToF 
                        distance measurements.

                    <p>The process noise and the sensor noise covariance matrices need to be specified for the Kalman 
                        Filter to work well. Sigma_3 was initialized as 20. This value was determined from slide 35 in 
                        Lecture 13 as well as the ToF sensor datasheet. Sigma_Z represents the mistrust in the sensor readings.
                        The ToF sensor has a ranging error of +/- 20mm in ambient and dark lighting.

                    <p>Sigma_1 and sigma_2 were initialized using the calculation found on slide 35 of Lecture 13. 
                        Sigma_U represents the mistrust in the Kalman Filter model. 
                        Sigma_1 is the relationship between the ToF distance reading and the model predictions.
                        Sigma_2 is the relationship between the velocity and the model predictions.

                        The initiallized sigma had a value of 20 for sigma_1 and 5 for sigma_2 as the robot is not moving 
                        initially.

                        Implement and Test Kalman Filter: Python</h3> <!--------------------------------------------->
                    <p>The below section includes the 5000 level task to use a faster frequency and use the Kalman Filter
                        prediction step to estimate the state of the car, as well as the same data graphed without the
                        prediction step for comparison. To write the below code I went to office hours to ask questions 
                        and looked at all of the lab reports for the TAs. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The below code for the Kalman Filter function was provided in the lab instructions and implemented in 
                        Jupyter Notebook.
                    </p>
                        <img width="600" height="auto" src="Lab7/KF_Function_Python.png"></img>
                    <p>The first two lines finding mu_p and sigma_p are the prediction step of the Kalman Filter. If 
                        there is no new ToF sensor reading, then the returned mu and sigma will be equal to what is 
                        found during the prediction step. Within the if statement there is the update step of the Kalman
                        Filter that runs every time there is a new ToF reading. The current state is mu, the uncertainty
                        is sigma, the motor input values are u, and the distance readings are y.
                    </p>
                    <p>To loop through each time step the below code was used.</p> 
                        <img width="600" height="auto" src="Lab7/KF_PythonLoop.png"></img>
                    <p>The while loop determines how many 
                        times the Kalman Filter runs. How many times the while loop runs depends on the the second to 
                        last time step for a ToF sensor reading and the value of Delta_T. If the value of the ToF time 
                        array is less than or equal to the value of the index, i, then the value of newTOF will be set 
                        to 1 and the update step of the Kalman Filter will run. If the value of the ToF time array is 
                        not less than or equal to the value of the index, i, then the value of newTOF will be set to 
                        0 and only the prediction step of the Kalman Filter will run. The index i is updated by adding 
                        Delta_T each time the while loop runs and the value of i is appended to the array KF_time to plot 
                        the Kalman Filter. After i is updated, the Kalman Filter function is called and then the output
                        distance (x) is appended to the KF_distance array to later be plotted. The u input was the negative 
                        value of 40 subtracted from the motor array storing PWM values, divided by 215 (the upper bound 
                        of 255 minus the lower limit of 40). The lower limit PWM value is 40. In this model if the motor 
                        input value is 40 then the value for u is zero (-(40-40)/215). 
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="mb-0">Filter Parameters</h5> <!------------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>Throughout the lab report I discuss the parameters used to modify the Kalman Filter and in the section below I
                        discuss how the parameters are modified to better fit the Kalman Filter to the ToF distance data.
                        To summarize, the parameters include the sampling time (Delta_T), drag (d), momentum (m), and sigma values
                        including Sigma_1, Sigma_2, and Sigma_3. The sigma values are used to find the covariance matrices: 
                        Sigma_U and Sigma_Z. Sigma_U represents the confidence in the model (distance and velocity) and Sigma_Z
                        represents the confidence in the sensor measurement. Drag is inversely proportional to speed and momentum 
                        is related to how much effort is needed to change the speed of the robot.
                        In extension, the values for drag and momentum affect the 
                        A and B matrices. Delta_T and the A and B matrices affect the values of the Ad and Bd matrices.

                    <p>Initially running the Kalman Filter using the previously described code results in the above graphs. 
                        The calculated Delta_T for the PID controller is 0.0066 seconds, a frequency of 151.52Hz. The Kalman 
                        Filter is running at a faster frequency than the ToF sensors. 
                        The deadband for the motor controller input is 40. This deadband is consistent to the deadband used 
                        in Lab 5 for linear PID control. This was the fastest run of the robot with a maximum PWM value of 
                        150. Sigma_1 and Sigma_2 are 122.86 and Sigma_3 is 20. Overall, the
                        model works fairly well, but at around 2 seconds the predictions no longer extend to the next data 
                        point compared to the earlier predictions. In the next step I modify the parameters to adjust the 
                        prediction values.

                    <p>I adjusted the parameters for Sigma_1. Decreasing Sigma_1 (model uncertainty for location) indicates 
                        that the model is more accurate than what was initially predicted from the calculation for Sigma_1. 
                        Sigma_2 was set to 120, which is close to the initial calculated value found previously and Sigma_3 remains at 20. 
                        All other parameters (d, m, and Delta_T) were kept the same as the previous step.
                        As can be seen from the graphs the Kalman Filter more closely follows the trend of the distance measurements.

                    <p>In the above graph I kept all previously found parameters the same but changed the value of the increment "i"
                        in the while loop. The line changed from "i = i + Delta_T" to "i = i + 2*Delta_T". This change results in 
                        less Kalman Filter predictions to be plotted. I initially did this to better see the individually plotted 
                        prediction points, but then realized that changing how often the while loop runs the prediction step of the
                        Kalman Filter results in the predictions to be slightly off from the ToF distance measurements and the 
                        previously plotted prediction values.

                        The Kalman Filter follows the general trend of the ToF readings, but is slightly off from the plotted line
                        for the ToF distances. I tried modifying the parameters as I did in the previous step, but there was no 
                        significant change in the Kalman Filter updates.

                        Sigma_3 (sensor uncertainty) was changed to 10 as the sensor readings were reliable.

                    <p>Prior to collecting the data to create the previous graphs, I tested the robot multiple times and 
                        collected distance readings. The distance readings were not as smooth as I would have expected 
                        and the robot moved slowly. I realized that my distance sensor was set to short mode, rather than 
                        long mode. The below data was collected before changing the sensor mode. I decided to run this 
                        data through the Kalman Filter for fun, to see how well the model would respond to non-ideal data.

                        more horizontal rather than continuing along the same slope as the distance sensor readings. I tried 
                        to address this issue in the next step.

                    <p>The objective of the lab to to gain experience working with PID controllers for orientation. 
                        I am a 5000 level student and I choose to work on a PID controller. Labs 5-8 detail PID, sensor 
                        fusion, and stunts. This lab is focused on using a PID controller for orientation control of the 
                        robot. The IMU will be used to control the yaw of the robot.

<!-- Lab 6 Prelab --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab</h2>
                    <p>I replaced one of my motor drivers that was overheating due to some solder touching between pins 
                        after I had to reconnect a loose wire. The new motor driver and connections solved the issue.
                    </p>
                    <p>I considered using tape around the wheels to reduce friction with the ground, but decided that I
                        did not want to change the surface of the wheels. During the lab I found the lower limit PWM value
                        for turning and implemented the found value as a lower limit for the motor control functions. The 
                        surface of the wheels is consistent with all past labs as I have previously found lower limit PWM
                        values for forwards/backwards motion using both wheels and one wheel, starting from stationary and 
                        moving at a constant speed before lowering the PWM. All of my found lower limit PWM values are for the 
                        same wheel surface.

                        <p>For this lab a PID controller will be used for orientation control of the robot. The below 
                            equation from the course Lecture 7 is used to compute the value for the PID controller:
                        </p>
                        <img width="350" height="auto" src="Lab5/PIDEquation.png"></img>
                        <p>This equation uses the error e(t) (difference between the final desired value and the current
                            value) in proportional, integral, and derivative control to calculate the new PID input value u(t).
                            For this lab the error is the difference between the desired angle (yaw)
                            and the robots current angle (yaw). The calculated PID input value is related to the robots 
                            angular speed. Proportional control multiplies a constant Kp by the error. Integral control multiplies 
                            a constant Ki by by the integral of the error over time. Derivative control multiplies a 
                            constant Kd by the rate of change of the error.
                        </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Send and Receive Data Over Bluetooth</h3> <!----------------------------------->
                        <p>For Lab 6 data was sent over Bluetooth in the same manner as the previous Lab 5.</p>
                        <p>Two Arduino IDE 
                            cases were initallized. The case ORIENTATION_CASE starts and stops the PID controller and the case
                            SEND_ORIENTATION_DATA sends the collected PID data to Jupyter Notebook. 
                            The PID controller starts 
                            when a command from Jupyter Notebook is run. The command inputs include a start(1)/stop(0)
                            value; the desired setAngle value to determine the desired angle;
                            and the Kp, Ki, and Kd constant values. In Jupyter Notebook a notification handler similar 
                            to the notification handler from Lab 1 is used to create the data array. The PID controller 
                            stops when the first input value is set to zero.
                        </p>
                        <p>I also determined what data I wanted to store and send to Jupyter Notebook. I stored the
                            time, yaw, error, proportional value, integral value, derivative value, PID value, right motor input,

                        <p>Below is the Jupyter Notebook Command and corresponding Arduino case to start/stop the PID 
                            controller. The run_ORIENTATION_CASE, setAngle, Kp, Ki, and Kd values sent from Jupyter Notebook are 
                            printed in the Arduino serial monitor each time a command is sent. These values were initalized 
                            as global variables and will be used in the PID controller that is written in the main void loop(). 
                            If a command to stop the robot is sent from Jupyter Notebook "Stopped Robot: " will also be

                    <p>The above link has the full final version of the code used during the lab. I attached the link 
                        for my own reference in the future. The below steps show how and why I wrote each piece of 
                        the code.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">PID Input Signal</h3> <!------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Integrate Gyroscope To Estimate Orientation</h4> <!---------------------------->
                    <p>The gyroscope reading was integrated using the following lines of code:</p>
                    <img width="550" height="auto" src="Lab6/Code/GyroInt.png"></img>
                    <p>These lines of code are within the larger while loop and each time the while loop runs the 
                        gyroscope updates the sensor readings. Yaw is then found using the previous yaw reading, the 
                        gyroscope reading, and the calculated difference in time.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Potential Problems With Digital Integration</h4> <!---------------------------->
                    <p>A potential problem with digital integration includes not having available data to properly 
                        integrate. The if statement to read IMU data only runs when data is ready. If data is not ready
                        then the PID controller will not be using the most current angle available. If there is no ready 
                        gyroscope data over time this might cause an issue. I observed the angle readings throughout the 
                        lab procedure and did not notice any significant gaps in data for the yaw calculations.
                        Another potential problem is gyroscope drift. If the IMU is continuously used the gyroscope 
                        readings will drift away from the actual angle of the robots location. To address this issue,
                        I set the initial yaw reading to zero every time I started using the PID controller.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">IMU Sensor Bias</h4> <!-------------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>Potential IMU sensor bias includes the placement of the IMU on the robot. If one of the IMU 
                        axis is not aligned with the center of the robot or if the IMU is not centered on the middle 
                        axis, then the calculated angle from the gyroscope sensor reading may not align with the 
                        physical location of the robot.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also checked to see if there was any numerical initial bias in the yaw calculations from 
                        the gyroscope by printing yaw readings to the Serial Monitor. I did not observe any bias when 
                        starting the PID controller.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Sensor Limitations and Maximum Rotational Velocity</h4> <!--------------------->
                    <p>The gyroscope sensor has four selections for rotational velocity. The selections are (+/-)250,
                        (+/-)500, (+/-)1000, and (+/-)2000 degrees per second. This information is from 
                        <a href="https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/medias/docus/306/PIM448_Web.pdf">this datasheet</a>.
                        Of the four potential configurations the settings of (+/-)500, (+/-)1000, and (+/-)2000 degrees 
                        per second will work for the purposes of this lab. The maximum angle that could potentially be 
                        used for robot motion control is 360 degrees, while smaller angles of 180 degress or less are 
                        preferred. The gyroscope configuration of (+/-)500 will be used to ensure that all potential 
                        gyroscope sensor data is collected.
                    </p>
                    <p>Other limitations of the sensor include being compatible with 3.3V or 5V, having 9 
                        degrees of freedom, and the accelerometer has four configurations including (+/-)2g, (+/-)4g,
                        (+/-)8g, and (+/-)16g. The accelerometer will not be used for this lab.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Orientation Control</h3> <!---------------------------------------------------->
                    <p>For the orientation control task the robot uses a PID controller and the calculated yaw angle 
                        from the gyroscope readings to move towards and maintain the set angle. The implemented PID 
                        controller works for various angles and on different floor surfaces.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Range and Sampling Time Discussion</h3> <!------------------------------------->
                    <p>The calculated yaw error from the gyroscope sensor can be at most 360 degrees. To determine 
                        the sampling time of the gyroscope readings I found the time between each new IMU measurement 
                        by temporarily adding a Serial.print(dt_G); line to the if statement inside of the while loop.
                        The sampling period was found to be 0.01s, resulting in a sampling frequency of (1/0.01s) = 100Hz 
                        for IMU measurements. 
                    </p>
                    <p>To find how fast the PID control loop is running I temporarily adding a Serial.print(dt_O); line 
                        inside of the while loop for the PID controller. The PID loop runs at around 0.01s (1/0.01s 
                        = 100Hz). The PID loop is running at around the same speed as the gyroscope sensor readings. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Rotational Lower Limit PWM</h3> <!--------------------------------------------->
                    <p>While I was initially testing the PID controller the lower limit PWM value was set to the same as the 
                        lower limit value of 40 from the previous lab. Using a lower limit of 40 resulted in the robot 
                        getting stuck and not fully turning. I created a new Arduino case and Jupyter Notebook command 
                        to find the lower limit PWM for turning. The code is below:
                    </p>

                        <img width="400" height="auto" src="Lab6/Code/ArduinoLL.png"></img>
                    <p>After testing various PWM values, I found that a lower limit value of 120 resulted in the robot 
                        turning. A video of the robot at a PWM value of 120 is below:
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="mb-0">PID Control: Arduino Code</h3> <!---------------------------------------------->
                    <h4 class="mb-0">PID Control</h4> <!------------------------------------------------------------>
                    <p>The Arduino code for PID control is below:</p>
                    <img width="500" height="auto" src="Lab6/Code/PID_Control.png"></img>
                    <p>Within the while loop if run_ORIENTATION_CASE is equal to 1, then the PID controller will run.
                        First the time is recorded and then data for the gyroscope is collected and yaw is found. The
                        error is the desired angle minus the yaw angle. The proportional control component is the error
                        multiplied by Kp (within line 660). The integral control component is the error integrated over 
                        time multiplied by Ki (lines 649 and 650). Wind up protection is used in lines 651-656. If the 
                        value of the integral term multiplied by the set Ki value is greater than 200 then there will 
                        be no further increase in the KiIntegral term used to find the value for the integral controller. 
                        Without wind up protection the integral term will continuously increase causing the robot to not 
                        stop when the final yaw angle is reached. The derivative control componenet is the rate of change 
                        of the error multiplied by Kd (lines 658 and 659). The derivative controller uses a low pass filter
                        and the gyroscope reading (gyrZ) as an input to reduce derivative kick when changing the setpoint.
                    </p>
                    <p>The PID controller works for both positive and negative angles. Inputs of positive angles turn the  
                        robot counter clockwise. Inputs of negative angles turn the robot clockwise.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Motor Control and Stopping</h4> <!--------------------------------------------->
                    <p>The robot is set to stop when the calculated error is less than 1 degree. All pins are then set
                        to zero. If the error is not within the stopping range than the functions RIGHT_MOTOR and 
                        LEFT_MOTOR are called. The if statements and functions can be found below.
                    </p>
                    <p>Stop when error is 1 degree or less or continue motion:</p>

                            <p>Right Motor:</p>
                            <img width="400" height="auto" src="Lab6/Code/RightMotor.png"></img>
                            <p>Left Motor:</p>
                            <img width="400" height="auto" src="Lab6/Code/LeftMotor.png"></img>
                     <p>For PID values greater than or equal to 120 and less than or equal to 255, the PID value is used as the input 
                        PWM value for the motors. For values greater than 0 and less than 120 the input PWM value 
                        is set to be 120, because PWM values less than 120 result in no motion of
                        the robot. For values greater than 255, the PWM value is set to 255 as that is the maximum
                        possible value for the motors.
                    </p>
                    <p>The two other ways to stop the robot are the same as in Lab 5. 
                        The first way is intentionally stopping the robot by sending 
                        a "0" value for run_ORIENTATION_CASE in Jupyter Notebook. Sending a "0" causes the following if 
                        statement in the while loop to set all pins to zero. 
                    </p>
                            <img width="300" height="auto" src="Lab6/Code/TurnOffManual.png"></img>
                     <p>The second way that the robot stops is if the maximum value for the collected arrays is 
                         reached, causing all pins to be set to zero and stopping the robot. This is to ensure
                         that each time the robot runs I know if the maximum array size is reached.
                     </p>

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Proportional Control (Kp)</h3> <!---------------------------------------------->
                    <p>I started with testing the proportional controller. I worked on finding a value for Kp, while 
                        keeping Ki and Kd zero. I choose an angle of 180 degrees to start testing the proportional 
                        controller. I estimated the Kp constant to be 1.4167 when testing 180 degrees. The equations 
                        are found below:
                    </p>
                    <img width="300" height="auto" src="Lab6/Code/KpEquation.png"></img>
                    <p>During physical testing I wanted the proportional control to slightly over shoot the desired 
                        angle. The over shoot will be addressed using derivative control and the speed will be 
                        addressed using integral control. A range of Kp values including 1, 1.5, 1.75, and 2
                        were tested as can be seen in the below
                        graphs showing yaw, error, PID components, and motor input. I determined that the Kp value 
                        should be 2. The code for the proportional controller is below:

                    <p>Trends that can be observed include, as the value for Kp increases the amount of time the robot 
                        takes to reach the desired angle decreases, but there is also more overshoot observed. As the 
                        value of Kp increases the motor input spends less time at the lower limit value of 120. For 
                        example, it is noticeably observed that for Kp = 1 the motor quickly reach the input value of 120 
                        and remains at that value until the desired angle is reached. For Kp = 2 the motors start at the 
                        upper bound of 255 and then decrease to the lower limit of 120 before reaching 180 degrees. I 
                        choose a value of Kp = 2 to then move to testing the proportional and integral controllers 
                        together.

                    <h3 class="mb-0">5000 Level Task: Integral Control (Ki) and Wind Up Protection</h3> <!---------->
                    <p>The next step involved using the proportional controller (with Kp = 2) and the integral controller 
                        to increase the speed of rotation and to achieve a small amount of oscillation at the desired angle. 
                        The integral controller is the constant Ki multiplied by integrated error over time. As time increases
                        the integrated error increases, resulting in a greater contribution of the integral controller. To 
                        prevent the integral controller component from increasing continuously, wind up protection was 
                        implemented. If the value of Ki mulitplied by the time integrated error is greater than 200 or less
                        then -200, then the KiIntegral is set to be 200 or -200 and does not further increase/decrease. The code for 
                        the proportional and integral controller is below.

                    <p>Trends that can be observed include, as the value for Ki increases the amount of oscillation 
                        and overshoot of the robot at the desired angle increases. The motor input for all tested 
                        values starts at the maximum of 255 before decreasing to a value of 120 before reaching the 
                        desired angle. For a value of Ki = 0.01 there is minimal overshoot and oscillation and a value
                        of Ki = 0.05 also results in minimal overshoot but slightly more oscillation. For Ki = 0.1
                        there is more oscillation before reaching the desired angle and for Ki = 0.2 the oscillation 
                        continues for a longer amount of time. I choose a value of Ki = 0.05 to move on to testing 
                        the proportional, integral, and derivative controllers together.

                    <p>The next step involved finding the value for the derivative constant Kd to remove overshoot at 
                        180 degrees. I initially calculated the derivative using the following code (line 15):

                        This resulted in a large spike for the first derivative control calculation as well as some noise 
                        as can be seen in the plotted graph for Kd = 0.05 below:

                        changed how the derivative control component was calculated. I used the information on 
                        <a href="http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/04/improving-the-beginner%E2%80%99s-pid-derivative-kick/">this website</a>.
                        Instead of calculating the derivative of a signal using the integral of another signal, I 
                        calculated the derivative using the Z output of the gyroscope using the following code:

                        This resulted in the large spike being removed, but there was still some noise in the derivative 
                        controller as can be seen in the plotted graph for Kd = 0.08 below:

                        I tested a serives of Kd values to find where the overshoot was reduced.

                    <p>For future navigation and stunts, I might need to change the setpoint in real time depending on the 
                        desired task. For this lab changing the setpoint was done through Jupyter Notebook, but changing
                        the setpoint could also be done through a series of if statements in Arduino IDE. Changing the
                        setpoint may be beneficial during navigation along with using data from the ToF sensor readings to 
                        navigate through the course.

                        an angle there is slightly more delay compared to on a flat surface, but the robot is still 
                        able to reach the desired angle. Below is a video showing the serial monitor outputs for the 
                        wind up protection. In the video the KiIntegral term increases over time until reaching 200
                        and then does not further increase.

                        drift may be needed to accounted for. In the below video the yaw drifts from 0.01 to -8.72 degrees
                        over (27.299 - 04.300) = 22.999 seconds,which is around -0.3796 degrees per second.

                    <p>The objective of the lab to to gain experience working with PID controllers. I am a 5000 level 
                        student and I choose to work on a PID controller. Labs 5-8 detail PID, sensor fusion, and stunts.
                        This lab is focused on using a PID controller for position control of the robot. Lectures 6, 7, 
                        and 8 were consulted during the lab.

                        <p>For this lab a PID controller will be used for position control of the robot. The below 
                            equation from the course Lecture 7 is used to compute the value for the PID controller:
                        </p>
                        <img width="350" height="auto" src="Lab5/PIDEquation.png"></img>
                        <p>This equation uses the error e(t) (difference between the final desired value and the current
                            value) in proportional, integral, and derivative control to calculate the new PID input value u(t).
                            For this lab the error is the difference between the desired distance from the wall (1ft) 
                            and the robots current distance from the wall. The calculated PID input value is related to the robots 
                            speed. Proportional control multiplies a constant Kp by the error. Integral control multiplies 
                            a constant Ki by by the integral of the error over time. Derivative control multiplies a 
                            constant Kd by the rate of change of the error.
                        </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Send and Receive Data Over Bluetooth</h3> <!----------------------------------->
                        <p>During the Prelab, I determined how to send and receive data over Bluetooth. Two Arduino IDE 
                            cases were initallized. The case PID_CASE starts and stops the PID controller and the case
                            SEND_PID_DATA sends the collected PID data to Jupyter Notebook. The PID controller starts 
                            when a command from Jupyter Notebook is run. The command inputs include a start(1)/stop(0)
                            value; the desired setDistance value to determine the desired end distance from the wall;
                            and the Kp, Ki, and Kd constant values. In Jupyter Notebook a notification handler similar 
                            to the notification handler from Lab 1 is used to create the data array. The PID controller 
                            stops when the first input value is set to zero.
                        </p>
                        <p>I also determined what data I wanted to store and send to Jupyter Notebook. Initially, I stored
                            time, two ToF distance values (one in millimeters and one in feet), the error value, the integral
                            value, the derivative value, and the PID value. Later in the lab I added and removed append 
                            statements as necessary depending on the task I was working on. The SEND_PID_DATA case sends time, 
                            distance in millimeters, the error value, P value, I value, D value, PID value, and the motor input
                            value.
                        </p>
                        <p>Below is the Jupyter Notebook Command and corresponding Arduino case to start/stop the PID 
                            controller. The run_PID_CASE, setDistance, Kp, Ki, and Kd values sent from Jupyter Notebook are 
                            printed in the Arduino serial monitor each time a command is sent. These values were initalized 
                            as global variables and will be used in the PID controller that is written in the main void loop(). 
                            If a command to stop the robot is sent from Jupyter Notebook "Stopped Robot: " will also be 
                            printed in the Arduino serial monitor. 
                        </p>

                        <p>Below is the Jupyter Notebook Command and corresponding Arduino case to send the collected data.
                            When data is sent the first time value is printed to the Arduino serial monitor to confirm that 
                            data was sent to Jupyter Notebook correctly. The time value is compared to the first time value 
                            in Jupyter Notebook.
                        </p>

                        <p>In addition, a hard stop was implemented on the Artemis to stop the robot if the Bluetooth
                            connection fails. The pin output values are all set to zero outside of the while (central.connected())
                            loop. The code for this is inside the larger void loop() and is seen below (lines 465-469):

                            <p>The above link has the full final version of the code used during the lab to collect 
                                distance measurements, extrapolate distance measurements, and move/stop the robot. 
                                I attached the link for my own reference in the future.
                                The below steps show how and why I wrote each piece of the code. 
                            </p>
                        <h3 class="mb-0">Position Control</h3> <!--------------------------------------------------->
                            <p>For the position control task the robot drives as fast as possible towards a wall and 
                                stops when it is 1ft away from the wall. The ToF sensor on the front of the robot will 
                                be used to determine the distance the robot is from the wall. The implemented PID control 
                                is also shown to be robust to changing conditions including starting distance and floor 
                                surface. 
                            </p>
                        <h4 class="mb-0">Range and Sampling Time Discussion</h4> <!--------------------------------->
                            <p>For this task I choose to use the long distance mode for the ToF sensor as I was testing 
                                the robot for longer distances ranging from 6ft to 13ft and the range for the ToF sensor 
                                when using the long mode is 4m (13.12ft). The ToF sensor error can be at most 4000mm. 
                                To determine the sampling time of the ToF sensor I found the time between each new 
                                distance measurement by temporarily adding the lines below to the code that runs when 
                                the case to start the robot is called: 
                            </p>
                            <img width="350" height="auto" src="Lab5/dtToF.png"></img>
                            <p>The sampling period was found to be 100ms, resulting in a sampling frequency of 
                                (1/0.1s) = 10Hz for distance measurements. To find how fast the PID control loop is
                                running I printed the value for dt that is calculated each time the PID loop runs:
                            </p>
                            <img width="250" height="auto" src="Lab5/dtPID.png"></img>
                            <p>The PID loop runs at around 8ms (1/0.008s = 125Hz). The PID loop is running faster than the ToF sensor 
                                produces new distance readings. This will be explored later in the lab as the ToF
                                sensor data will be extrapolated to use estimated data when there is no new ToF sensor
                                distance measurement. 
                            </p>
                        <h4 class="mb-0">Proportional Control (Kp)</h4> <!------------------------------------------>
                            <p>The first control input I worked on was the Kp input for proportional control. I estimated 
                                the value to be around 0.06899 by using the below equation to solve for the PWM values. I wanted 
                                to minimize overshoot, so to find the value for the error I subtracted the final desired 
                                distance from the maximum error based on the ToF sensor readings. The equations used can 
                                be found below:
                            </p>
                            <img width="350" height="auto" src="Lab5/KpEquations.png"></img>
                            <p>The initial loop used to find the PID value is:</p>
                            <img width="400" height="auto" src="Lab5/NewPIDInitialLoop.png"></img>
                            <p>First the time difference (dt) is found and then the error is calculated based on the current 
                                distance and desired stopping distance. After the error is calculated the integral and 
                                derivative terms are solved for (both are 0 in this step). 
                                These PID equations were also used during the next step to find the Kd value for derivative
                                control.
                            </p>
                            <p>I used the calculated Kp value (0.06899) as an estimate. During the first physical testing of the system 
                                I tested a range of Kp values to determine 
                                at what point the robot oscillated around 1ft in front of the wall. Two of these Kp values are found graphed
                                below. I determined that the Kp value should be set 
                                to 0.03 to minimize the error and oscillation present.
                                The graphs showing Time vs ToF Distance, Time vs P Control, and Time vs Error 
                                for Kp = 0.05 and Kp = 0.03 can be found below:

                            <iframe width="550" height="400" src="https://youtube.com/embed/_73SAd107NA"></iframe>
                            <p>In the above videos it can be seen that for a value of Kp = 0.05 the robot moves faster 
                                but overshoots and oscillates more, resulting in a greater error, compared to when Kp = 0.03. 
                                Larger Kp values resulted in the robot moving faster and having more error in the final 
                                position. Kp = 0.03 was the smallest value for Kp that resulted in the robot completing 
                                the full motion.
                                For this first task I 
                                wanted to reduce oscillation, rather than achieve a faster speed and moved to the next 
                                step using Kp = 0.03. I focused on achieving a faster speed when tuning the integral 
                                Ki value, and prevented overshoot when tuning the derivative Kd value.

                            <p>The robot is set to stop when the calculated error is less than 5mm. All pins are then set
                                to zero. If the error is not within the stopping range than the function FORWARD is
                                called if the PID value is greater than zero, or the function BACKWARD is called if 
                                the PID value is less than zero. The if statements and functions can be found below.

                            <p>For PID values greater than or equal to 40 and less than or equal to 255, the PID value is used as the input 
                                PWM value for the motors. For values greater than 0.5 and less than 40 the input PWM value 
                                is set to be 40, because assigning values less than 40 would result in no motion of
                                the robot. For values greater than 255, the PWM value is set to 255 as that is the maximum
                                possible value for the motors.
                            </p>
                            <p>Prior to writing the FORWARD and BACKWARD functions for scaling, I tried using map() 
                                to scale the PID values to PWM motor input values. The written code can be found 
                                <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v-03PIDdVK9giT-E1sIs_6NjfWNxw-9e/preview">in this folder</a> 
                                This approach was not used because when running the robot, I repeatedly entered into a Fault Handler. In a 
                                first attempt to fix this problem I removed all code in the Arduino script that was 
                                not being used for this lab to reduce the size of the code, but that did not solve the 
                                Fault Handler issue. I then wrote the 
                                previously discussed functions to move the robot. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Another way to stop the robot are either intentionally stopping the robot by sending 
                                a "0" value for run_PID_CASE in Jupyter Notebook. Sending a "0" causes the following if 
                                statement in the while loop to set all pins to zero. 
                            </p>
                            <img width="200" height="auto" src="Lab5/TurnOffManual.png"></img>
                            <p>The final way that the robot stops is if the maximum value for the collected arrays is 
                                reached, causing all pins to be set to zero and stopping the robot. This is to ensure
                                that each time the robot runs I know if the maximum array size is reached.

                            <p>The next task I worked on was tuning the Kd value using proportional control and 
                                derivative control at the same time. I wanted to prevent overshoot and any oscillation 
                                of the robot. I increased the Kd value until the overshoot was reduced and the robot 
                                stopped at the 1ft desired 
                                distance from the wall. This Kd value was found to be Kd = 5. A video showing 
                                the robot at Kp = 0.03 and Kd = 5 is below:

                            <p>For this task the ending setpoint distance does not change, resulting in the error 
                                derivative to be continuous. I did not need to implement anything to get rid of derivative 
                                kick because there is no changing setpoint. I did consult the reference provided in the 
                                lab instructions and read about derivative kick 
                                <a href="http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/04/improving-the-beginner’s-pid-derivative-kick/">on this website</a>,

                            <p>In addition a low pass filter for the derivative was not implemented as all of the calculated 
                                derivative error values were small.

                        <h4 class="mb-0">5000 Level Task: Integral Control (Ki) and Wind Up Protection</h4> <!------>
                            <p>For the next task I added the integral controller and inputed a Ki value. To start I set 
                                Kd to zero and tested a value of Ki = 0.00001 and Kp = 0.03. This resulted in the robot 
                                moving very fast into the wall. I then decided to decrease Ki until I found a value where 
                                the robot would stop in front of the wall, but for each value tested the robot ran into the wall.
                                I then implemented wind up protection for the integral control to prevent the robot from 
                                overshooting and running into the wall. The Arduino code that was added can be found below:
                            </p>
                            <img width="550" height="auto" src="Lab5/WindUpPIDLoop.png"></img>
                            <p>First a distance measurement is taken at the start of the robots motion to determine the 
                                total distance the robot needs to move and an integralStop value is set to be half of 
                                the total distance travelled. Each loop an if statement checks to see if the error is
                                greater than the integralStop value. If the error is greater then integralStop a new 
                                integral value will be calculated. If the value of the integral term multiplied by the 
                                set Ki value is greater than 100 then there will be no further increase in the KiIntegral 
                                term used to find the PID control. In additon, if the error is smaller then the integralStop value 
                                then the new integral value will be set to zero. The integral term is the Ki value multiplied by 
                                the time integrated error. Without wind up protection the integral term will continuously increase 
                                causing the robot to not stop when the final distance is reached. Below is a video showing the 
                                KiIntegral (I) terms continuously increase until stopping at 100. The error term is not changing 
                                significantly, but the KiIntegral (I) term continuously increases.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After implementing wind up protection I found a Ki value that allows the robot to lightly run 
                                into the wall before
                                pulling back. I started with a Kp value of 0.00001 which resulted in the robot driving 
                                too fast into the wall. I decreased this value until Ki = 0.000008 resulted in the 
                                following performance when Kp = 0.03 and Kd = 0:
                            </p>

                            <p>Without wind up protection the robot accelerates quickly and the following behavior 
                                is observed:
                            </p>
                            <iframe width="550" height="400" src="https://youtube.com/embed/xd15OHNZmwM"></iframe>
                            <p>I then added the Kd term found in the previous step. A value of Kd = 5 resulted in more 
                                overshoot than I wanted the robot to have. I increased the Kd value until the overshoot 
                                was again minimized. This resulted from a value of Kd = 8. For values above Kd = 8 there 
                                was no longer a noticable difference in minimizing overshoot. The behavior for Kp = 0.03, 
                                Ki = 0.000008, and Kd = 8 can be seen in the three trials below. The robot was started 
                                from a distance of 6.5ft.

                            <p>Graph Analysis and Deadband:</p>
                            <p>The above graphs for the distance and error reading show that there is minimal 
                                over shoot and the robot stops at the desired distance of 1ft away from the wall.
                                The graph for Time vs Motor Input shows that the initial motor input is 58 and 
                                decreases until a motor input of 40 is reached. The deadband for the motors is 40.
                                Any value between 0.5 and 40 (forward) or -0.5 and -40 (backward) will be set to 40
                                in order to produce a PWM value that causes the motors to move. I choose a lower bound 
                                of 0.5 and -0.5 to prevent the robot from overly moving after reaching the final distance.
                                The functions used to produce forward and backward motion were discussed previously in the 
                                section for Proportional Control. When the robot stops the motor input changes to zero.

                            <p>The maximum linear speed of the robot can be found using the Time vs ToF Distance graph. Using 
                                two points on the graph it can be found that (1506mm - 707mm)/(36105ms - 38258ms) = 0.37m/s

                                (1/0.1s) = 10Hz for distance measurements.

                                readings. Extrapolation will be used to estimate the distance when new data is not 
                                available using past ToF distance readings.

                            <p>Due to the ToF sensor running slower than the PID loop, extrapolation is used to estimate the distance
                                using past data points. Below is the extrapolation equation:

                            <img width="300" height="auto" src="Lab5/ExtrapolateEquation.png"></img>
                            <p>This equation was implemented in the Arduino code. An if statement checks if the ToF distance sensor 
                                has a new distance reading. If the sensor has a new distance reading then that point is added to 
                                the distance_data array and the current time and distance are stored in time1 and dis1 variables. 
                                The previous time and distance from the last time there was a new distance measurement are stored 
                                in the time2 and dis2 variables. If there is no new distance reading the extrapolation equation is 
                                used as can be seen in line 395. The Arduino code for extrapolation is below:

                                The first printed value is the raw data and the second printed value is the extrapolated data. The
                                video shows that the extrapolated data readjusts whenever a new raw distance value is received.

                            <p>Below is a graph for the raw and extrapolated distances. The graph is zoomed in to show that the 
                                extrapolated data (orange) readjusts to the raw data reading (blue) every time there is a new distance 
                                measurement. In the next section I ran tests using the extrapolated data.

                            <p>In addition, I tested the extrapolated distance PID control using different starting distances.

                            <p>In the above videos it can be seen that the robot stops 1ft in front of the door, however 
                                for the largest tested distance of 13ft there were some runs where the robot did not 
                                go straight and instead curved towards the wall. This behavior can be seen 
                                in the second 13ft video. To correct this behavior orientation control can be 
                                implemented to keep the robot moving straight. 
                            </p>
                            <p>As a note, the PID control for the robot was tested on two different types of flooring
                                as can be seen throughout the lab videos. The behavior of the robot on both surfaces 
                                was the same using the PID control. One surface was tile the other was laminate wood 
                                flooring.

                        <p>The objective of the lab is to control the car using open loop control, rather than the 
                            manual controller. Two dual motor drivers will be connected to the car's motors and the 
                            Artemis board. The dual motor drivers will be used to control the movement of the car.

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Sketch Of Wiring Diagram</h3> <!----------------------------------------------->
                        <p>Below is a wiring diagram for the two dual motor drivers connected to the Artemis board, 
                            DC Motors, and 850mAh battery. The two VIN pins and the two GND pins on both dual motor 
                            drivers are connected together and then connected to the 850mAh battery. The GND pin of 
                            one of the dual motor drivers is connected to the GND of the Artemis board. There is a 
                            bridge between the BOUT1 and AOUT1 pins of the dual motor driver that is then connected 
                            to the DC motor. There is also a bridge between the BOUT2 and AOUT2 pins of the dual motor 
                            driver that is then connected to the DC motor. There is a bridge between the BIN1 and AIN1 
                            pins on the dual motor driver and there is also a bridge between the BIN2 and AIN2 pins. 
                            On the dual motor driver that connects the drivers to the ground of the Artemis board (top 
                            dual motar driver in sketch below), the bridge between BIN1 and AIN1 is connected to pin 11, 
                            and the bridge between BIN2 and AIN2 is connected to pin 12. On the other dual motor driver 
                            (bottom dual motor driver in sketch below) the bridge between BIN1 and AIN1 is connected 
                            to pin 7, and the bridge between BIN2 and AIN2 is connected to pin 9. The pins used in this 
                            lab were chosen from the remaining pins on the Artemis board (after the previous lab). The 
                            parallel-couple of the two inputs and two outputs on each dual motor driver allows for 
                            twice the average current to be delivered without overheating.

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Battery Discussion</h3> <!----------------------------------------------------->
                        <p>The Artemis board and the motor drivers/motors are powered from separate batteries. The 
                            Artemis board is powered using a 650mAh battery and the motors are powered using a 850mAh 
                            battery. Having the Artemis board and motors powered by different power sources avoids 
                            any potential transient effects and allows each component to function independently. Any
                            potential current changes in the motors will not affect the Artemis board. In addition, 
                            the motors require a higher current battery, which is the reason the 850mAh battery is 
                            used to power the motors.

                            <p>The below image is a picture of the power supply and oscilloscope connections. The 
                                positive power supply wire (red, towards the top of the picture) is connected to the 
                                positive wire of the battery. The ground wire of the power supply (black) and 
                                oscilloscope (black) is connected to the same ground wire of the battery (near the 
                                middle of the picture). The input for the oscilloscope (near the bottom of the 
                                picture) is connected to the wire that will be attached to one of the motors. Each of 
                                the four wires that will be attached to the motors was tested to determine if the 
                                circuit was assembled correctly and a PWM signal was shown on the oscilloscope.

                            <p>The voltage of the 850mAh battery is 3.7V. In place of using the battery, a power supply 
                                was used. The output of the power supply was set to 3.7V to represent the battery 
                                power that will be used later on during the lab. Each pin was tested independently of 
                                each other. In the Arduino IDE code, one pin was set to have an output of 200, while 
                                the other pins all had an output of 0. This was repeated for all four pins. The positive 
                                output voltage to the motor was displayed on the oscilloscope and indicated a constant 
                                voltage output at each time. The PWM values show that power can be regulated on the motor 
                                driver output.

                        <h4 class="mb-0">Video Of Wheels Spinning (Each Side Of Robot)</h4> <!---------------------->
                            <p>The wheels on each side of the robot were tested individually at two different output 
                                values. The power supply used at the beginning of the lab (3.7V) was used to power 
                                the motors. Pins 7, 9, 11, and 12 were tested at output values of  50 and 200. While 
                                testing each side of the robot I observed the direction and speed that each wheel 
                                turned. The wheels rotated faster for the higher output at 200 compared to the output 
                                at 50. For the higher output value of 200, the wheels reached the final set speed faster 
                                compared to the lower set speed. When rotating at 50 the wheels took longer to start rotating.
                                From the perspective of the videos pin 7 rotates counter clockwise and pin 9 
                                rotates clockwise. Pin 7 and pin 9 move the wheels on the same side of the robot in 
                                different directions. In addition, from the perspective of the videos pin 11 moves 
                                clockwise and pin 12 moves counter clockwise. Pin 11 and pin 12 move the wheels on 
                                the same side of the robot in different directions. To consolidate the report, all

                            <p>The Arduino code to test the wheels is found below. One pin was set to have an output 
                                value of either 50 or 200 and all other pins were set to have an output value of 0.
                                This is the same code that was used in the previous section to test if the circuit 
                                was working properly before sautering to the motors.

                            <p>After testing each side of the robot, all of the wheels were tested at the same time. 
                                The 850mAh battery was used to power the motors instead of the power supply. The below

                            <p>After connecting all components to the car I decided to test how the robot moves. The 
                                video below shows my first test for having the robot drive on the ground. In the video, 
                                the robot initially moves towards the left when the pins used for the motors have the 
                                same output value. This trend was noticed in future steps of the lab when determining 
                                how to calibrate each of the motors.

                            <p>During this step of the lab, I used Bluetooth to send a command from Jupyter Notebook 
                                to run different output values more easily compared to uploading Arduino IDE code every
                                time I wanted to change the output value of a pin. The below images show the Jupyter
                                Notebook Command and the Arduino IDE case that uses analogWrite() to move the robot.

                            <p>The lower limit PWM value is the lowest output value that a pin can be set to that will 
                                still result in continuous motion of the robot. The wheels on one side of the robot 
                                were tested, while the wheels on the other side remained stationary. The lower limit 
                                PWM for pin 11 (right side) was found to be 59. The lower limit PWM for pin 7 (left
                                side) was found to be 50. 
                            </p>

                            <p>I also found the PWM value for both wheels when they are being used together, starting 
                                when the robot is stationary. The output value was found to be 35 for both wheel sides.

                            <p>Note: During lab office hours I asked a TA (Larry Lu) about how the surface conditions 
                                affect the PWM values. Specifically I asked if testing the robot on the floors in my 
                                apartment (laminate wood flooring) would change the lower limit PWM value compared to 
                                the tile floors in the lab and hallways. I tested the robot's lower limit PWM value at 
                                my apartment and received the same PWM values. The PWM values may start to differ if 
                                the robot is travelling over a surface with a lot of friction such as a carpet or 
                                outside in the grass. This information is helpful to know as I can better understand 
                                the operating conditions of the robot.
                            </p>
                        <h4 class="mb-0">Calibration Demonstration</h4> <!------------------------------------------>
                            <p>The wheels of the robot do not spin at the same rate and a calibration factor needed 
                                to be implemented. The below video shows the robot moving in a straight line, starting
                                at 7 feet and then continuing past the end of the tape measure. For the demonstration,
                                pin 11 was set to an output of 60 and pin 7 was set to an output of 70. In addition to 
                                the below video, the robot was run multiple times at varying input values. My first 
                                tested value was pin 11 at an output of 60, which is close to the found PWM value from 
                                the previous step. When pin 7 was set to an output of 51, the robot continuously moved 
                                towards the left. Through trial and error I found that an output of 70 for pin 7 kept 
                                the robot moving in a straight line. I used these found values for reference during 
                                future tests: 70/60=1.166666666666667. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I increased the output of pin 11 by 20 for each 
                                test and multiplied the value for pin 7 by 1.166666666666667. This incrementation worked 
                                for all tested pin 11 and pin 7 values until I reached an output value of 220 for pin 11. 
                                The calculated output value for pin 7 should be 257, rounded down to 255 due to 255 being
                                the maximum output value. For this test the robot continuously moved towards the right 
                                and the value for pin 7 needed to be lowered to 250 to keep the robot moving straight. 
                                Due to this discovery, I decided to also test an output value of 210 for pin 11, the 
                                calculated output value for pin 7 should be 245. In order to keep the robot moving 
                                straight, and not to the right I needed to reduce the output of pin 7 to 240. The trend 
                                shows that after an output of 200 for pin 11 the calibration factor to find the 
                                corresponding output value for pin 7 starts to differ. 
                            </p>
                            <p>In addition, as a final test I 
                                wanted to determine how low I could set the output values while still having the robot 
                                move in a straight line for at least 6 feet. I set the output value of pin 11 to 40 and 
                                calculated the output value of pin 7 to be 47. For these output values, the robot moved 
                                in a straight line for more than 6 feet. When I set the output value for pin 11 to be 
                                lower than 40 the wheels began to stall and hesitate before rotating compared to the other 
                                side of the robot. I also included a video at the end of the section showing the wheels 
                                spinning.
                            </p>
                            <p>To produce the robots motion the same Arduino IDE case and Jupyter Notebook command were 
                                used from the previous section. The length of the delay was changed depending on how fast the robot moved (to prevent 
                                the robot from running into a wall). All of the recorded videos are in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MPB9ob9C-Wnmy3WKEV63vXBIjMhBrcxV?usp=drive_link">this folder.</a>

                            <p>Below is a graph showing all of the tested values as data points. In addition, I plotted the 
                                trendline for all data points, as well as the trendline for all of the data points except 
                                for the last two that began to differ from the previous measurements. The slope and 
                                y-intercept were also found for each trendline. The calculated slope is the calibration 
                                factor. The slope excluding the last two data points, 1.165 is close to the 1.166666666666667
                                value.

                            <p>I also tested the calibration factor when the robot is going in "reverse" (with the robot 
                                moving in the direction away from the ToF sensor on one end). I initially tested the 
                                previously found output values with the corresponding pins on each wheel side, with pin 12 
                                having an output of 60 and pin 9 having an output of 70. I found that by doing this the 
                                robot moved towards the left. I decided to switch the output values; pin 12 has an output 
                                of 70 and pin 9 has an output of 60). The robot moves straight using these output values. 
                                I find this interesting as it confirm my previous thoughts about one side of the wheels 
                                being slightly misaligned.

                                spins clockwise, and then stops. I used output values found from the calibration graph.

                            <p>Below is the image of the oscilloscope when connected to the circuit. The wheel motors 
                                are powered using the battery. During lab office hours I asked a TA why the oscilloscope 
                                outputs were more noisy compared to the oscilloscope outputs from earlier in the lab and 
                                it is most likely because the circuit is now connected to the motors that result in more 
                                noise compared to when the circuit was not connected to the motors on the robot.

                                generates is about 1/0.0065s ~= 154Hz. In lab 3 the sampling period of the ToF sensors
                                was found to be 0.04s and the sampling frequency was 25Hz. The frequency analogWrite() 
                                generates is fast enough for the motors on the robot when running tests as well as when 
                                using data from the ToF sensors. Manually configuring the timers to generate a faster PWM
                                signal will allow for more control over the movements of the robot and a more steady PWM 
                                signal.

                            <p>The lowest PWM value for each side of the robot was found by running the robot with an 
                                initial output of 60 for pin 11 and 70 for pin 7 to correspond with the found 
                                calibration values. The robot ran with these outputs for 3 seconds and then all pin 
                                outputs were set to zero expect either pin 11 or pin 7. Either pin 11 or pin 7 remained 
                                turned on for another 3 seconds, but decreased to a lower output value. I ran the robot 
                                multiple times to determine at what output value the robot no longer moved. It was 
                                determined that for pin 11 the lowest PWM output is 35 and for pin 7 the lowest PWM 
                                output is 33. The videos for each pin can be found below.
                            </p>

                            <p>Pin 7 with a lowest PWM value of 33:</p>
                            <iframe width="550" height="400" src="https://youtube.com/embed/y8LbCTM5KOg"></iframe>
                            <p>In addition, the lowest combined wheel PWM value was found when both wheels were being 
                                used at the same time. The output value for both wheels (pin 11 and pin 7) is 25 when 
                                the robot is already moving. The robot was initially run with an initial output of 60 
                                for pin 11 and 70 for pin 7 for 1.5 seconds and then both wheels decreased to an output 
                                of 25 for 5 seconds. Below are two videos. One video shows the final output at 25 (the 
                                robot moves until the total set time of 5 seconds is over). The other video shows the 
                                robot stop before the 5 seconds is over and the motors stall when set to an output of 
                                24, confirming the lower limit PWM value of 25 to keep the robot moving.

                        <p>From the datasheet it was found that the I2C sensor address for the ToF sensor is 0x52. 
                            The two ToF sensors have the same address and one of the addresses will need to be changed 
                            in order to receive data from both sensors at the same time. 
                        </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Task 2: Approach To Using Two ToF Sensors</h3> <!------------------------------>
                        <p>To use two ToF sensors, the XSHUT pin will be used to connect one of the ToF sensors to pin 
                            8 on the Artemis board. The XSHUT pin will be set to LOW and then the I2C sensor address 
                            will be changed for the other ToF sensor that is on. After the I2C address has been changed 
                            the XSHUT pin will be set to HIGH, turning the other TOF sensor back on. This will allow for 
                            both ToF sensors to be used in parallel. 
                        </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Task 3: Placement Of Sensors On Robot</h3> <!---------------------------------->
                        <p>The placement of the two ToF sensors on the robot will impact the field of vision. Two 
                            long QWIIC connectors will be used to attach the ToF sensors. Longer connectors will allow 
                            me to position the ToF sensors in more potential ways compared to shorter wires. The 
                            potential arrangements of the sensors include (1) a sensor on the front and left side, 
                            (2) a sensor on the front and right side, (3) two sensors positioned on either side of 
                            the front of the robot, and (4) a sensor on the front and the back. Depending on the task 
                            at hand any of these sensor positions may be effective. 
                            If there is no sensor on the back of the robot there might be an issue if the robot needs 
                            to back up or move in reverse. If there is no sensor on the side then the robot might miss 
                            an obstacle that is located in a blind spot.

                            <p>One ToF sensor was connected during the scan. The sensor had an I2C address of 0x29. 
                                In the datasheet for the ToF sensor, the listed I2C address is 0x52. The 
                                Example05_Wire_I2C.ino code returned an address of 0x29. This is a result of the 
                                binary for address 0x52 (binary: 0b01010010) being shifted to the right, resulting in 
                                an address of 0x29 (binary: 0b00101001). The rightmost bit is ignored because the bit 
                                identifies if data is read/write.

                            <p>The ToF sensor has two modes: (.setDistanceModeMedium(); //3m has been removed)

                            <p>Information from the datasheet shows 
                                that the short mode can only reach up to 1.3m and is the most resistant to ambient 
                                light. The long mode can reach up to 4m but is very sensitive to ambient light, which 
                                decreases the distance to 0.73m. The timing budget range for the short mode is 20ms - 
                                1000ms. The timing range for the long mode is 33ms - 1000ms. Short mode has greater 
                                accuracy and less sensor noise compared to the long mode. While it would be beneficial 
                                for a robot that needs to sense objects farther away to use the long mode, for this lab 
                                I am prioritizing accuracy and choose to test the short mode.

                            <p>In the datasheet it is stated that the short mode for the ToF sensor has a range up to 1.3m.
                                To test the range of the sensor I took an initial measurement at 100mm and continued to take 
                                measurements up to 1900mm. The graph below shows the actual distance of the ToF sensor from 
                                the wall vs the ToF sensor distance.
                                The plotted measured distance value is the mean value of the ten collected data 
                                points. From the graph below it can be seen that after 1.3m the measured values start to 
                                differ more from the actual values compared to measured values less than 1.3m.

                            <h4 class="mb-0">Active and Passive Infrared Sensors</h4>
                            <p>The two main types of infrared sensors are active and passive infrared sensors. Passive 
                                infrared sensors sense nearby emitted infrared light, using a difference in signals 
                                between two pyroelectric sensors. These sensors are often used for security 
                                purposes to detect if there is a heat energy change in the environment, but cannot 
                                determine the distance to an object.
                                Active infrared sensors use an emitter and receiver to determine the distance
                                to an object.  
                                If there is an obstruction, the active infrared sensor knows that there is an object 
                                in between the emitter and receiver. Active infrared sensors are used in industry 
                                conveyor belts, as well as in garage door safety mechanisms.

                                Different types of infrared sensors include proximity sensors, ToF sensors, and triangulation sensors.

                            <p>Four colors and three textures were tested at a distance of 500mm. Colors include pink, 
                                blue, yellow, and red. Textures include a hand towel, rug, and folder. The control 
                                surface was the dark grey wall that I used throughout the lab for distance readings.
                                The change in color or texture did not affect the ToF sensor's distance output that 
                                remained around 478mm.

                        <h4 class="mb-0">IMU Example Code and AD0_VAL</h4>
                        <p>The example code found under 
                            SparkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout - ICM 20948 - Arduino Library->Arduino->Example1_Basics 
                            was run to test if the IMU was working correctly. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon opening the Example1_Basics code, the AD0_VAL default was set to one. When the ADR 
                            jumper is closed the value should be set to zero. AD0_VAL corresponds to the last bit 
                            of the I2C address. My ADR jumer on the IMU was closed. For this reason, I needed to 
                            change the AD0_VAL to zero to return the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and 
                            temperature data.
                        </p>
                        <p>While viewing the output data 
                            in the serial monitor, I moved the IMU to change the accelerometer and gyroscope data. I 
                            looked at the notated axis that was printed on the IMU and moved the IMU along the X, 
                            Y, and Z axis. I noticed that the respective X, Y, and Z serial monitor outputs for the 
                            accelerometer increased 
                            when I moved the IMU along the respective positive axis. The gyroscope data for pitch, roll, 
                            and yaw also changed when I rotated the IMU around the X, Y, and Z axis.

                        <p>These equations were used to compute pitch and roll for the accelerometer. I implemented the

                            Note: The data for the graphs was collected by holding the IMU against the table using my hand. 
                            This may have resulted in some error due to the surface level or any small hand movements. In the
                            future the IMU should be calibrated when it is secured to the robot to achieve the most accurate 
                            pitch and roll data.

                        <p>The noise in the accelerometer was examined using a Fast Fourier Transform. Data for the FFT was 
                            collected as I moved the IMU. The sinusoid and the FFT graphs can be found below. There is a large 
                            spike closer to 0Hz and less noise as the frequency increases. 
                            Note: I modified the code from Stephan Wagner's Ed Discussion post to plot the FFT graphs.

                        <p>From observing the above graphs, I choose a cutoff frequency of 25Hz to use for a low pass filter. 
                            Using the determined cutoff frequency, I calculated the alpha used in the low pass filter. The 
                            equations from lecture are below:

                        <p>The low pass filter was implemented in Arduino. The code to find pitch and roll for the accelerometer

                            due to a pre-existing internal low pass filter. The information for this can be found on page 10 of 
                            the <a href="https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/813/DS_000189_ICM_20948_v1_3-2489786.pdf">datasheet</a>

                        <h4 class="mb-0">Speed Of Sampling</h4>
                        <p>All of the accelerometer and gyroscope data print statements and any delays in the ble_arduino.ino file were removed 
                            in order to speed up the execution of the main loop. A case called "ACC_GYR" was created that checked if the data was 
                            ready in the main loop, and if there was data available stored it in arrays. After speeding up the loop I found that 
                            new values were sampled every 0.04s, which is a sampling frequency of 1/0.04s = 25Hz.

                        <p>The data is stored in arrays on the Artemis board before being sent to Jupyter Notebook. There are 7 arrays including 
                            time (1); accelerometer: x (2), y (3), z (4); gyroscope: x (5), y (6), z (7). I choose to use separate arrays because
                            in the future I can decide what data I want to send to Jupyter Notebook. The data type used to store the data is a float.
                            I choose to use a float as it is less bytes then a double, allowing for more data to be stored on the memory of the 
                            Artemis. A float is 4 bytes, resulting in one packet of data information for the 7 arrays to be 28 bytes. The Artemis has 
                            384kB of RAM. Sampling at 0.04s (25Hz) will result in data being collected for 548 seconds.

                        <p>The robot is moved using the controller. The robot can move very quickly, but it is hard to 
                            control the speed. If the robot changes directions too quickly there is a chance that it 
                            might flip over. It is also hard to slow down the robot to a stop. When slowing down the 
                            robot, the reverse needs to be applied. This is easy to over compensate and the robot might 
                            end up traveling in reverse rather than coming to a stop.

                            <p>The Artemis board was programmed to turn on the LED when the musical note A4 is played

                                and I added if statements (lines 113-122 below). The note A4 is 440Hz 
                                <a href="https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week8/scale.html#:~:text=The%20frequencies%20440Hz%20and%20880Hz,12%20notes%20in%20every%20octave.">(UC Berkeley Reference)</a>. 
                                The first if statement determines if the frequency is between 430Hz and 450Hz to account 
                                for any slight error in sound quality. If the frequency is within range an “A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn on. 
                                The second if statement determines if the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 
                                450Hz. If the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 450Hz a “Not A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn off.

<!-- Lab 1 Part 1 Discussion --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Discussion: Part 1</h2>
                    <p>I tested the connection between the Artemis board and the computer. Tasks performed included 
                        turning on and off an Artemis board LED, printing serial monitor outputs, viewing temperature 
                        data in the serial monitor, testing the microphone, and creating a musical tuner. 
                    </p>
<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-5">Part 2</h2>
                    <p>Tested the Bluetooth communication between the computer and the Artemis board. Python in a 
                        Jupyter Notebook was used for the computer and Arduino IDE was used for the Artemis board.
                    </p>
<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 Prelab: Setup ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab: Setup</h2>
                    <p>During the setup for the lab I already had installed Python 3. I needed to install pip by 
                        running the line "python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv" in the Command Line Interface 
                        (CLI). I created a folder called “MAE 5190 Lab” where I put all of the Jupyter Notebook files. 
                        I then created a virtual environment by typing "python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble" in the CLI. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The virtual environment was activated by typing "source FastRobots_ble/bin/activate" and then 
                        deactivated by typing "deactivate". 
                    </p>
                    <p>The python packages were installed by entering "pip install numpy pyyaml colorama nest_asyncio 
                        bleak jupyterlab" into the CLI.
                    </p>
                    <p>CLI entered commands:
                    </p>

                    <p>I also needed to install matplotlib to use for the 5000 level tasks. I asked a TA for help with 
                        the installation. Below is a picture of the command entered into the CLI.
                    </p>
                    <img width="auto" height="30" src="assets/img/matplotlib.png"></img>
                    <p>To import modules into the Jupyter Notebook the following lines of code were run.

                    <img width="550" height="auto" src="assets/img/ImportModules.png"></img>
                    <p>After uploading the provided ble_ardunio.ino file to the Artemis board the MAC address was 
                        printed in the serial monitor. The MAC address is c0:83:34:6a:b2:3c The image below shows 
                        the Arduino serial monitor with the printed MAC address.

<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 Prelab: Codebase --------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab: Codebase</h2>
                    <p>I installed the provided codebase into the project directory and copied the provided 
                        “ble_python” directory into the project directory. Then the Jupyter Notebook was opened by 
                        entering “jupyter lab” into the CLI (shown below).
                    </p>
                    <img width="auto" height="20" src="assets/img/jupyterlab.png"></img>
                    <p>To set up Bluetooth communication, the MAC address needed to be changed in the Jupyter 
                        Notebook connection.yaml file to match the advertised MAC address from the Artemis board. 
                        Then unique UUID addresses needed to be used in the connection.yaml file and Arduino IDE 
                        because some devices in the lab may have the same MAC address. Using UUIDs ensures that 
                        the computer is receiving data from the correct Artemis board. The UUIDs were generated in 
                        the Jupyter Notebook demo.ipynb file and then entered into the connection.yaml and 
                        ble_arduino.ino files. Below is a picture of the lines of code used in the demo.ipynb file 
                        to generate the UUIDs.

                    <p>Several command types needed to be defined to complete the tasks outlined in the next section. 
                        Added commands include ECHO, GET_TIME_MILLIS, GET_TIME_MILLIS_LOOP, SEND_TIME_DATA, 
                        and GET_TEMP_READINGS.

                                readings were taken at the same time. The data is sent as an array to the computer

                            <p>The method used in Task 4 involved sending the current time from the Artemis board to 
                                the computer. Each time was sent as an individual piece of data. The method used in 
                                Task 5 involved creating an array of times that was stored on the memory of the 
                                Artemis board and then sent to the computer to display the collected data. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The data transfer rate of the array method used in Task 5 (549600 bytes/second) is 
                                faster than the data transfer rate when sending individual pieces of data in Task 4 
                                (1348.018 bytes/second).
                            </p>
                            <p>An advantage of sending data individually as in Task 4 is that less memory on the 
                                Artemis board is being used, but the disadvantage is a slower data transfer rate. 
                                An advantage of sending data as an array as in Task 5 is that there is a faster data 
                                transfer rate, but a disadvantage is that more memory is being used on the Artemis 
                                to store the array.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Artemis board has a maximum storage of 384 kB of RAM. If 16 bit values at 150 Hz 
                                were sampled every 5 seconds, 256 values would be stored before running out of memory 
                                on the Artemis board. The calculations can be found below.

                            <p>I sent a message from the computer and received a reply from the Artemis board. The data 
                                rate for 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 bytes was tested. The 
                                data rate for 5 bytes is 132.722 bytes/s and the data rate for 120 bytes is 2003.210 
                                bytes/s. The plotted graph shows that as the number of bytes sent to the Artemis board 
                                increases, the data rate increases. Below are pictures of the Jupyter Notebook code, the 
                                graph, and the printed statements.

                            <p>I tested the reliability of sending data at a higher rate from the robot to the 
                                computer. To determine the reliability of the data I ran the GET_TEMP_READINGS 
                                command and compared the outputs printed in the Jupyter Notebook and the Arduino 
                                IDE Serial Monitor.

                            <p>After looking at the outputs, the time and temperature readings on the computer are 
                                the same as the Artemis board and no data is missed. To confirm I copied and pasted 
                                the data from each window into Matlab variables titled time1 and temp1 for the 
                                Jupyter Notebook data, and time2 and temp2 for the Artemis data. I wrote a script to 
                                compare the corresponding time and temperature data and record how many data points 
                                are the same and how many are different. If there is a data point in the Jupyter 
                                Notebook that does not correspond to the Artemis board, or vice versa, an error 
                                message is displayed. The output variables in the workspace show that all data points 
                                are the same. The reliability is 100%.
