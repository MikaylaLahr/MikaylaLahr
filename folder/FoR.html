                                    The kinematics model of the MuSHR car created previously will be implemented in 2D. 
                                    First, the derivation of the kinematics model is computed by hand by annotating the 
                                    lengths and angles in the below figure. 
                                </p>

                                    These kinematic car equations were implemented in Python in a deterministic manner. 
                                    An initial state and control is given and the equations are integrated to return a 
                                    new state. This implementation is then expanded upon to create a deterministic motion
                                    model. A plot showing the car turning left, going straight, and turning right is below.
                                </p>

                                    Finally, noise is added to create a more robust model. The added noise is parametrized by
                                    action noise and model noise. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Part 2.2 Motion Model Parameters</h3>
                                <p>
                                    To better understand how the noise parameters affect the simulation characteristics of the 
                                    probabilistic motion model are plotted. The inital state is in green, the state from 
                                    integrating the deterministic model is in red, and the particles are in blue. Multiple noise
                                    parameters were plotted until the desired plots were achieved. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When tuning the parameters for the plot, I initially set every parameter to zero and plotted the resulting graph. When all of the parameters are zero, the single red and single green arrows remain in the same position. The blue arrows for plot (1.0,0.34,0.1) are behind the red arrow, around (0.2,0) on the graph. The blue arrows for plot (3.0,0.4,0.5) are slightly above and to the left of the red arrow, around (0.7,1.1) on the graph. I then turned on parameter on at a time with a value of 0.5 to determine how each parameter affects the graph.

Modifying vel_std resulted in the arrows being extended in a line in the direction that the arrow is pointed in. Modifying alpha_std resulted in the arrows forming a curve. Modifying x_std resulted in more arrows plotted in the direction of the x axis. Modifying y_std resulted in more arrows plotted in the direction of the y axis. Modifying theta_std resulted in the tail of the arrows being plotted at the same point and the head of the arrows being slightly apart from each other.

                                <p>
                                   The simulation is set up for a kinematic car model that includes noise by 
                                   implementing and integrating equations to describe the ideal motion of a mechanical 
                                   system. The simulator is run using an XML launch file that specifies which ROS nodes 
                                   should start. The visualizer is shown below.
                                </p>
                                <strong>RViz Visualizer for MuSHR Car Simulation</strong>
                                <p></p>
                                <img src="PNG_FoR/RViz.png" width="800" height="auto">
                                <p>
                                    There are several features implemented in RViz to help visualize the simulator. On 
                                    the right side is a views panel that includes options for the "Target Frame" such as 
                                    "base_link" for traking the car or "map" for not traking. The top of the visualizer 
                                    includes features such as a 2D Pose Estimate that returns the numerical coordinates 
                                    of the cars position. The left side shows the ROS topics that are accessed by RViz 
                                    including the "Map", "Grid", and "RobotModel".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After setting up the simulation and visualizer, a subscriber was created to calculated
                                    a Manhattan Norm. The calculation was implemented in two different ways including Python
                                    for loops and using functions from NumPy. The run time for both implementations were 
                                    compared over 100 runs and the mean and standard deviation were plotted in the below graph. 
                                </p>

                                    The implementations shows that the execution time when using NumPy functions is faster than 
                                    when using Python for loops. A subscriber was initialized to the car's pose topic. The x and y
                                    position of the car was extracted from the pose message and saved. The positions were ploted 
                                    and the Manhattan Norm was computed for all xy-locations. Below are plots showing the path of
                                    the car along with the computed Manhattan Norms.
